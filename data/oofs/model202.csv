If it is shown the way it is to be felt; not twisted to make it funny or less serious that people will be drawn to it more.

A second rule states that the main character must not be a completely good or evil man, but a man who has a few small flaws that lead to disaster. Another very important rule is that the events of the play must progress from good to bad, and it must end terribly for the main character so that those emotions mentioned in rule one are felt clearly.

The second element of an ideal tragedy is that the emotions and experiences had by the character must appear reliable to the reader as these are the precise emotions that a tragedy aims to make the reader feel.  By allowing the reader to actually feel tragedy they are left with the emotions of a tragic conclusion which brings me to the final aspect of an ideal tragedy.  The final element of a proper tragedy is that the conclusion must remain tragic; meaning that the character must not see his conditions reverse.

For example, Romeo and Juliet create a situation in which they both end up killing themselves over the death of the other. In Greek tragedies, the characters must live with their mistakes and suffer, while in Shakespearean tragedies, the characters die.

The characters in a tragedy should also not start from a spot of despair and work towards success. While a basic development from fortune to adversity would also not be ideal for a tragedy, adding more complexity to this story and including aspects that encourage fear or pity would contribute to developing an ideal tragedy. The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy.

That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a trade must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error. That way ,the audience will feel both pity and fear knowing they could have acted similarly. Anything else will not evoke the proper emotions.

Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be reliable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity. A third element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should not resemble a comedy. A tragedy has to be serious, in order for the audience to feel fear, pity, and slight sympathy towards a character.

Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Tedious and Theses because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky.

In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end.

If it instead brings prosperity to adversity, the play doesn't invoke pity or fear and the result is just shock to the viewer, which is not the intention. A complex plot is also involved in an ideological tragedy. Tragedies aim to be ""single in tissue, rather than double as maintain."" The plot should also not follow a storyline that goes from bad to good, but actually good to bad.  Lastly, character is another important aspect. Character is usually one that is considered to be a person who is good, but suffers misfortune and even their downfall due to their own judgement, making them very reliable.

Evoking pity and fear from an audience are staples to a basic tragedy because such strong emotions practically entice the audience into the story; the audience may be able to see themselves in the story presented. The downfall of the story's villain in a tragedy should not be included because such event would only satisfy the audience and their moral sense. Pity and fear would not come from a villain's downfall because the evil had been defeated for the sake of what is ""good"" in the story. The main character of a tragedy should be balanced because their grey morality in views has the audience wonder if theiractions were deserving of such misfortune. It invites pity for the main character due to the main character not being wholly bad, just that their errors in judgement sadly brought them to misfortune.",226,0

When a tradegey exits pity and fear, it usually starts with a change of fortune. In the text it says, ""... that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" This part merely shocks the audience.

A complex plan of a plot is extremely important in order to have an ideal tragedy.  The plot must move from the beginning to the end according to a cramped sequence of events that are to happen.  Furthermore, another element to an ideal plot is character.  ""Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Tedious, Forests, Mileage, Theses, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible"".

Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not deprived; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.

Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot.

In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Tedious, Forests, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune.

The tragedy must pass feelings of terror and commotion to the public, it should be highly emotional and precise. A tragedy also must have intimate language and actions that engage the readers and excite pity and fear. The language and actions bring different alliances and excitement throughout. The language should be pleasant and easily understood by the audience. A tragedy must have true tragic endings and not resemble comedies.

Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4).

The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a reliable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.

If the story isn't complex then the story wouldn'te entertaining and enthralling to the reader. The story need to be long enough for the audience to understand the long suffering that the protagonist  goes through. The second element of a good tragedy would the progress from good to bad fortune throughout the story.  A tragedy isn't a tragedy if the protagonist has a happy ending because it just isn't tragic. In order for the story to be tragic there needs to be a great amount of misery and woe involving the protagonist having the good things in life take from them throughout the span of the story. The third element of a good tragedy is an unhappy ending. If the story ends happily for the protagonist then the story is not at all sad or tragic. We as people prefer to have a story end happily for the protagonist because it sits with us better. We prefer to walk away knowing that the main character got what they always wanted and that they found joy in the end.

Aristotle states and centers all of his other arguments around the tragedy actually producing fear or pity.

Another element that is described by Aristotle is that main character must have a change of fortune. Aristotle states that ""...the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity..."" and says that the character ""whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Aristotle believed that the character needed to have a change of fortune which he believed should be from good to bad and it needed to be because of himself. Another element expressed by Aristotle is that tragedies should have a bad or unhappy ending. He states ""Hence they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending.""

The character that is not successful, or  ""good and just"" will also be the charter who isn't a bad person but is judged because of some ""error"" or past situation that is now defined as his reputation. Instances like that in movies are predictable which doesn't make them tragedies anymore. The last ideal tragedy is spectacle. The spectacle part of tragedy refers to how things are seen. Such as characters, the set up of the movie or play, how they dress and sound and other things along that line. Spectacle can occur in tragedy because everything isn't as it seems.

The tragedy should, ""come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" (Paragraph 3) Lastly, the ideal tragedy shifts the mood from good to bad, most often ending the same way. The text says, ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad... this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."" (Paragraph 3) As described the ideal tragedy moves the plot from good to bad, which continues until the end of the play. ",270,0

Aristotle's main points help readers to understand tragedies, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""  In contrast, character displays men's qualities, ""the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families.""

While the primary character or the hero within these pieces should be an individual which is situated between the two extremes of incredibly just an incredibly evil, they should be neither be the epitome of faintly and good while they should neither have their downfall be brought to them due to their depravity or vice which they possess and should instead occur due to their own frailty or a minute error of judgment or mistake, and they should be an individual which is both prosperous and renowned being well known and plentiful within their lives or be other individuals connected to families which are of this variety. As well as that the plot which is maintained by these works should possess a singular issue or complication which it is revolving around, and the alteration within the character's fortune should be from that of good to poor and it should not occur due to a vice they possess and instead due to an error within the character previously described or one which is even better than that, though never worse, and within these pieces, there is what people call a bad or unhappy ending.",284,0

The main character can't be a ""bad man passing from adversity to prosperity"" (Paragraph 2) but also can't be ""a man who is not eminently good and just"" (Paragraph 2). The main character has to be neutral, neither good nor evil. At the same time, a tragedy has to induce pity and fear. A tragedy can't have ""the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited"" (Paragraph 2) because that wouldn't bring fear or pity, but we rejoice instead. For a ideal tragedy, pity should be ""aroused by unmerited misfortune"" (Paragraph 2) and fear by ""the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (Paragraph 2). The final element is that the main characters fortune ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Paragraph 3) and should be caused ""by some error of judgement or frailty"" (Paragraph 2). A neutral character, a story that evokes pity and fear, and have good fortune go to bad fortune because of the main character's judgement are the elements that make an ideal tragedy.",291,0
2.2160711,1.5244282,c8c77fd9fb07,39c16e,"As described by Aristotle, three elements of an ideal tragedy would be that the plot should feature the downfall of a man who is not completely evil but who has a flaw which causes his downfall, that it should cause fear and pity in the audience, and that it should have a complex plot, but not a plot with two thread that has two different catastrophe for the good and the bad.  Aristotle  believes that the goal of a tragedy is to ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and argues that in order for the tragedy to accomplish this goal, it should feature the downfall of a hero ""who is neuter eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought on not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" He thinks that if the hero were purely good, his downfall would simply be shocking to the audience, whereas the downfall of a purely evil man would not arose pity or fear, since ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" and the audience would instead derive moral satisfaction from seeing the evil man get what he deserved. Finally, Aristotle writes that while a tragedy should ""be arranged not only the simple but on the complex plan"" but that there should not be a ""double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and bad"" because in that case the sense of pleasure from the audience will not be ""true tragic pleasure"" but closer to what the audience would feel when watching a comedy.",303,0
2.0243027,1.2225832,26e11646cf98,39c16e,"Aristotle describes many elements that should be included in a tragedy in On Tragedy. First, he believes that an ideal tragedy should have events that evoke pity or fear for the protagonist. He states this in paragraph two: ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" He goes on to explain how the audience will feel pity or fear- by portraying a protagonist who is not particularly good or evil, just an ordinary person who falls into misfortune. Second, Aristotle claims that a good tragedy should have a suitable plot that is not too complicated and in which the fortune turns from good to bad because of the characters' actions. He establishes this in the third paragraph: ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse. "" Finally, Aristotle highlights that the play should not be written based on what the audience wants- ""It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience. The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure"". Those are three of the elements that Aristotle says should be in an ideal tragedy.",306,0
2.184974,1.8229007,1acf92125772,39c16e,"Three of the main elements of a great tragedy are as follows: actions that incite pity and fear, a change of fortune from good to bad, and the exclusion of the utter downfall of the villain. Aristotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to fall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good trade, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villain dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components. If that story has these three main elements - pity and fear, misfortune, and the avoidance of the downfall of a villain, it would make a great tragedy.",317,0
2.5779865,1.926483,1b82ce4967e9,39c16e,"One of the elements Aristotle claims is crucial to constructing an ideal tragedy is the emphasis on building a story out of pity and misfortune. As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narrative as it progresses. Next, Aristotle exclaim that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be reliable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil past. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Tedious, Forests, Mileage, Theses, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible."" This describes how building narratives based around icons of tragedies enhances the feelings of pity and misfortune when the main characters experience the tragedies themselves.",320,0
2.4305875,2.1018474,f5154ae8d89c,39c16e,"The first element of an ideal tragedy is that there should be a complex plan rather than a simple plan. According to the text, Aristotle states that ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (para 2). This would mean that an ideal tragedy would essentially evoke extreme emotions, like pity or fear from the audience, but not merely indicate a change in fortune of a person from good to bad that does not cause any significant reaction from the audience. The second element of a tragedy, as mentioned, there should be a reversal in fate going from good to bad and not from bad to good. An additional detail should include the idea that the misfortune causing a person to go from ""prosperity to adversity"" (para 2) should be ""unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (para 2). This means that the misfortune should be in a manner that the person suffering the misfortune does not necessarily deserve it. Only then is it thought that pity or fear will be evoked to be considered as an ideal or effective tragedy. The third element of an ideal tragedy is the misfortune coming about due to ""some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse"" (para 3). This would mean that there should be some error either caused by the person receiving the misfortune or by the part of some surrounding error. As a result, the error should lead to the misfortune as a whole and in turn evoke fear and pity from the audience. ",322,0
2.630021,2.3236582,57d4aad66e97,39c16e,"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and sympathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy. ",335,0

In the chapter from Poetic, Aristotle states, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged... on the complex plan"" (Paragraph 2). When Aristotle says this, he means that there should be actions that entertain pity, fear, and bring in the ""tragic"" part of the writing. There has to be a bundle of emotions to make the audience feel a certain way for the character. In the chapter from Poetic, Aristotle also states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its assure, rather than double as some maintain"" (Paragraph 3). This means that there should be a plot that goes from good to bad. This provides an emotional connection to the character with their successes, but as the ""bad"" part comes in, you wil feel for the character. In the chapter from Poetic,  Aristotle states, ""It is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectator; for the poet is guided in what he writes by the wishes of his audience"" (Paragraph 4). If you write the ending in the audiences wishes, they will be more intrigued. It's in the best wishes that the poet ends the writing in the audiences wishes, it will result in pleasure.

In paragraph 2, he states, ""...imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man...""  Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous..."" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or happiness. This is truly defined as a tragedy because of  how these types of common endings surprise the audience as it might be something unexpected.",344,0

Though he stresses many ideas, they all fall into general elements that must be included, which includes the actions must spark pity and fear, the change in fortune should be from good to bad, and this shift shouldn't be due to one's bad habits rather from an error of judgment or frailty. Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and shapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit. Aristotle made the elements of tragedy, expressing pity and fear, making sure it was good to bad, and that it wasn't a normal error of the person rather bad judgment, clear through his writing.",348,0

Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an ""end unhappily. It is... the right ending."" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satisfies ""the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear."" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when ""some great error or frailty"" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it's similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be. However, Aristotle wants to make it more known that a short story can be constructed in an emotionally compelling way part of which still applies even in modern times.",361,0
2.3427398,1.9660275,eb76bd210a89,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy, as summarized by Aristotle, is that there should be a serious change in circumstances of the main character, specifically a change from good circumstances to bad, instead of bad to good. Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behavior. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

2.4000084,1.8645699,32f23f665431,39c16e,"According to this reading, Aristotle views the concept of an ideal tragedy by using elements of six different parts, but the most important according to him, are elements of plot, character, and thought. First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

2.750864,2.2053318,888abfac4dc6,39c16e,"As described by Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is one that effectively voices it plot through a single lens from which is complex and venturing out into different perspectives instead of and rather than being clear and concise and simplistic to a certain degree. This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgency of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortune actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""",372,0
2.3672707,1.8058509,25e459261b79,39c16e,"Aristotle was one the smartest philosopher's at this time and had many opinions on how a tragedy should be written. Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be reliable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more reliable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Forests and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'. This is what Aristotle characterized Greek tragedies by during his time as a philosopher.",397,0

When discussing a tragic character, Aristotle states that it is important to have a character that the audience can relate to. He does this when he says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families."" He states that it is important to have a character with these traits because it aroused fear and pity in the audience. He states this throughout paragraph two when he says ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This takes away from a true tragedy because in the end, the protagonist must face their downfall. ",430,0
2.0506036,1.2831339,66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Fiction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisfying moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisfying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",482,0

The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, "" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arose both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becoming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the misfortune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a ""spectacle,"" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience. ",612,0
2.8245008,2.341954,574369ff8f20,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy must have a replaceable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageous and medically evil that succeeds because of their malevolent, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audience will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphant when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have replaceable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Forests and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",733,0

They had to pay the Pharaoh , hold the governments post and please the gods. Since they believed that gods were present through their time.

The slaves are prisoners and are forced to work on building projects while the farmers grow and take care of animals and keep canals going. The farmers pay tax to the pharaoh (giving them hay income of a famine that gets stored in the warehouse) and they are the ones who provide the food. Next come the soldiers and craftsmen/woman. The soldiers help fight and also supervise the farmers/peasants when there is peace. The craftsmen make jewelry and sell things to the people and the merchants go trade and also give to the public.

This also shows Character S society. becuase it shows ho some people are actually that harmless to create something like this. A most cant control this and that unfair becuase it means if you dont agree then it wont matter. Think of it like you get into an arguement with maybe a sibling and you get your parent into it so they agree on something that sounds fair to them but not to you and they dont listen you would be upset but this system was way more harsh becuase it made  others basically be able to control you life. This system was los to show respect to people at the top or second becuase they felt more and were believed to be morals, and they wanted great power so they thought lets do this and people will respect us.....that is the insane system they had.",344,1

Finally, the last social class within the government are the nobles. They are the only class that can hold government positions. They gained money through the tributes, or gifts paid to the pharaoh.

For instance, although the pharaohs and state leaders held control over what the laws were,  people could still choose whether they wanted these laws or not. Additionally, an example of a different social class being involved in the government were farmers. Farmers were taxed up to 60% of their crop to the pharaohs annually, (Paragraph 12.)

Farmers tended the fields. raised animals, kept canals, and reservoirs in good order, worked in stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could do as much as 60% of their yearly harvest stated on paragraph 12. Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades.  These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on a gain employment in the government stated on paragraph 13.  That is how the system of Ancient Egypt worked. ",533,1
2.6116626,1.6159233,4aac0bb1600f,3b9047,"Ancient Egypt's system of government is different from what ours is like today. At the top of Egypt's system of government, is the gods. The gods were at the top because the Egyptian believed that the gods controlled the world. In the text it states, ""Egyptian believed that the gods controlled the universe."" The quote from the text shows that the gods were in charge. Next, on the system of government was the pharaohs. The pharaohs had lots of power. The text says, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects."" The quote shows that the pharaohs had a lot of controls. The pharaohs also directed the army in case of a conflict. According to the text, ""The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. "" The quote shows they had power. Then, below the pharaohs were the nobles and the priests.  The nobles held government posts, and the priests were responsible for pleasing gods. In the text it says, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Next, were the views. The views ensured that all taxes were collected. The text says, ""The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" The quote above shows that the views had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.Also, the scribes worked with the views. The scribes kept government records. They could also read and write. In the text is says, ""Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt — they could read and write."" This shows that they had an important skill and job. At the bottom of the structure were slaves and farmers. Slaves were forced to work on building projects. The slaves had to do hard labor. The farmers worked on the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good shape, and much more. To prove that, the text states, ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments."" Farmers also paid taxes that could take away as much as 60% of their yearly-harvest.  As one can see, all people in ancient Egypt had  job, and that ancient Egypt's social structure is different from today. One can also see how different levels of social classes had different power. Egypt's system of government played a important role in ancient Egypt. ",592,1
1.8992004,1.4124312,64f540d9f37d,3b9047,"The text says that the social structure works similar to that of a pyramid.  At the top, of course, is the gods. Because, I mean, THEY'E GOD. Underneath them is the Pharos. This is due to the fact that people believe that the Pharos were the human versions of the gods. The Pharos held the most responsibility and were the most powerful. They were also buried within stone pyramids. Beneath the Pharos lies the Nobles, who essentially were the government. To quote from the text, they ""profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh."" Oh yeah, and the Priests (also up here with the Nobles) had the job of making sure that the gods were happy, and didn't hypothetical cause the destruction of humanity,  but THAT DOES'T MATTER. Anyway, next is the middle class. the middle class, of course, was in the middle.  It contained craftsmen(men refering to both men and women, plus the possible addition of nonbinary keeps if the term hypothetical existed at the time) and shopkeeper. But what did they make? What did they sell? Well what do YOU think?? Ok, I might understand if you were having trouble figuring out what craftsmen did(which was make things such as jewelry,pottery, and tools by the way),  but shopkeeper??? I think you might be able to find out yourself. O, MOVING N, we have soldiers. Who, in most societies, you might expect to be higher than the middle class, but NE. THEY'E T THE BOTTOM. Well, not at the bottom, but.. Let's just say that in the egyptian society, you're either at the top, or at the bottom. And, despite the existence of the middle class, HERE Id Ns INBETWEEN. So, yeah. Soldiers. They uh, fought in wars, of course, and they also supervised the peasants and farmers...That's all I really know. Sorry. Alright, and now the moment in which you bois n goals n nonbinary pals have all been waiting for...the absolute bottom...the lowest of the lows...drumroll please...SLAVES AND FARMERS, ALL! Light so slaves were essentially made out of a whole bunch of keeps who were taken captive during war, and such. They were used to work on building projects, and let's be honest, were probably treated like crap. And farmers, on the other hand, were...FARMERS! And they did, uh...Very..Farmer-y things. They..THEY EE FARMERS. They also helped build royal monuments, and, to quote from the text, ""paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest"". So, if their yearly harvest were hypothetical around, let's say...$10,000, then they'd be left with...*calculating*...$4,000. So, when it came to taxes, farmers, too, EE TREATED. IE. CAP. (and I personally dont think that the farmers should be so low because unlike everyone else, they make the food that's KEEPING EVERYONE LSE A L I V E. that's just how I see it thought.)",695,1
2.7156029,1.746815,d5a135e55d4d,3b9047,"The base starts with farmers and slaves. The economical positions rise as they go up. At the very top point of the pyramid are the gods. Here is the order from greatest to least: Egyptian Gods/Pharaohs,  nobles/priests, soldiers, craftsmen/traders, and lastly farmers/slaves. The gods are at the highest position in status. They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, ""They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All the laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh."" Because the pharaohs/gods couldn't do all the duties themselves they have assistants called vizier which are chief ministers. They have the duty of collecting taxes from people like farmers. According to the article, ""No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" Called a ""chain of command"" the vizier have assistants as well.  They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods/pharaohs there are the nobles/priests. According to the text, the only people who can develop government posts are the nobles. And priests' duties are to keep the gods satisfied. Like said in the text, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Also, the nobles grow very wealthy from receiving all the gifts of the gods from the subjects. Next are the soldiers. The soldiers fight in wars or end ""domestic uprisings."" Also, they sometimes keep an eye on farmers, peasants, and slaves. As said in the article, ""Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces."" Next comes the middle class which is made up of skilled people life artisans, craftsmen/women, and physicians. The craftsmen would create jewelry and other products and then sell them to make some money. They were known as the merchants and storekeepers. ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public."" And at the bottom/base are the farmers and slaves. The farmers has to raise animals, take care of the fields, conduct some tasks in the stone quarries, construct royal monuments, and are responsible to keep the reservoirs and canals in shape. They also have to pay 60% of their annual harvest towards tax. ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs  in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest—that’s a lot of hay!""  Although people can't raise their status, young boys can go to school to learn how to read/write and then can become scribes or can apply for employment in the government which would make their status rise. The slaves have to work on developing projects and put extreme effort at the direction of the nobles or pharaohs. ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.""",814,1

In Excerpt From The Jungle by Upton Sinclair, light is shed on the corrupt practices of the meat industry as they would taken the bones out of rotten ham and pickle ham to reduce the odor in attempts to cover it up from the rest of the population.",283,2

In paragraph 3 it states ""when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta. Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions- a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference"". This shows yet another way in which the factory would use spoiled meat, by cutting it up so that fresh meat could be mixed with a small amount of the spoiled meat, thus discussing the spoiled meat. In paragraph 4, it also states that ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs. There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it"".

When they used the machine to pickle the ham there were still some that came out sour. Some of them were too sour to stand. Then they would pump the sour ham with an even stronger pickle that got rid of the smell. For the hams, they would stuff odds and ends of pork into casings. California hams were shoulders, knuckle joints, and most of the meat cut out. The skinned hams were old hogs that were tough and no one bought until it was cooked and chopped to be head cheese. When the whole ham was spoiled they mixed it with good meat and canned.  The moldy sausage that came from  Europe was dosed with borax and glycerin. They sent it out to shops again.  Poisoned rats went in the sausage along with the spoiled chopped up meat. The waste barrels were cleaned out once in a while and mixed with fresh meat to go to shops.  Some of it would be made into smoked sausage. They would rub it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it look brown and sell it. All of these methods were disgusting.

The workers would also pickle their meat to get rid of the odor but if it was very urgent, they had a second and much stronger pickle which helped destroy the smell, which the workers called, ""giving them thirty per cent."" Along with this, they would label the packages in many ways to make it look like it was ""original"" even if they were made out of meat parts that were not supposed to be used. Another form in which they would use and cover-up spoiled meat would be by getting spoiled whole ham and old sausage with mold from Europe and losing it with borax and glycerin, where it would then be dumped into hoppers and made over again for packaging. Mice, feces, poisoned bread, dirt, diseases, and sawdust were just a few things that would be processed in the hoppers along with the spoiled meat. Lastly, they would also use their chemistry department to make sausages appear brown-with the use of borax and colored gelatin- and labeled it ""smoked"" sausage after their practice of smoking sausage became expensive for the factory.

Specifically, Sinclair reveals the immoral actions that transpired in an attempt to cover up spoiled meat.  Sinclair indicates that the factories covered up spoiled meat through masking doors, refusing rejected meat, and combining normal meat and rat meat simply out of pure laziness. For example, Sinclair states that the meat ""would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" That quote in itself explains one of the many attempts in which the factories hid their corrupt techniques. Additionally, Sinclair incorporates vivid and descriptive imagery to illustrate the masked meatpacking process. Sinclair states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats."" The explanation regarding the rats and the leaky rooms emphasizes the feeble conditions located in the specific offices. Another way in which the factory workers hid their spoiled meat was by supplementing porous pickles to the most spoiled portions of meat. This was done in an attempt to mask the speech of the meat.

This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or colorless products in order to mask the speech. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with spoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906).

This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick. In paragraph 2 it also states, ""... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty percent'"" (Sinclair par.2). When the speech from the meat was bad enough workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the doors.

(3) Sinclair explains that these factories are willing to risk the health of many human beings for some more money. Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees swell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminated meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner"" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, ""With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge"" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their ""family"".

To save time and increase their capacity, they used a machine that would be able to pickle a ham in a few seconds, but would sometimes leave the hams spoiled with a disgusting odor. To solve this issue, the packers used a stronger pickle. After smoking the hams, some would be found to have gone bad but were still sold to the public as ""Number Three Grade"". To solve this problem, they decided to extract the bone and insert a white-hot iron, getting rid of all but Number One Grade. To be able to keep selling to the general public, the packers made up numerous schemes and ""they had what they called 'boneless hams,' which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and 'California hams,' which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy 'skinned hams,' which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no  one would buy them--that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled 'head cheese!'""

3.1409447,2.0873678,8c39908257e3,ebad26,"There were various ways that factories would use or cover up spoiled meat. The employees played a huge role in why meat was processed under harsh conditions. Workers lacked washing their hands, and the water that men washed their hands in was also ladled into sausages. Meat would be tumbled out on the floor in dust and dirt. Meat would fall onto surfaces where employees have spit thousand of times. As a result of this, meats were extremely treacherous. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs."" The meat was also in a space where rats were present, causing rats to run across the meats. As a result of rats running around, they poison them. After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely sanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it."" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat ""spoil."" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat. According to the text, it states, ""Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as ""Number Three Grade,"" but later on, some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron."" The workers also rubbed meat in soda to get meat to go from sour to sweet and change the bad odor. After doing this, they would provide it to people over the free lunch counter. These conditions were very harsh, but workers did not care about receiving the public; they only wanted money. ",464,2
1.5432856,0.25773144,9d63142fd55a,ebad26,"The ways that the meatpacking  factory would cover up spoiled mean was doing things such as injecting chemicals into it and even taking every bit of the left over spoiled meat and blending it up to put it int sausage. This quote states,"" Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus,
 by which they saved time and increased the capacity
 of the plant—a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor—a process known to the workers as “giving them thirty per cent.” Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as “Number Three Grade,” but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade—there was only Number One Grade. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled 'head cheese!'"" This quote proves that they used these methods to cover up spoiled meat.",485,2
2.520041,1.6093882,f0f383b6ca09,ebad26,"The meatpacking houses would disguise the taste, smell, color, and presentation of the meat to cover up the fact that it was spoiled. Sinclair describes the process from the word of a pickle room worker, ""... the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose. "" (Paragraph 2).  He goes on to explain that they still worked with meat that had an unbearable smell to the workers and they would just pickle the meat stronger to destroy the oder. He also added that The meatpacking houses would disguise the taste, smell, color, and presentation of the meat to cover up the fact that it was spoiled.

"" (Paragraph 2).  He goes on to explain that they still worked with meat that had an unbearable smell and they would just pickle the meat stronger to destroy the oder. He also added that that some spoiled meat that contained white coloring and mold would be used for sausages and home consumption.  Sinclair starts to  explain the sausage process, ""Some of it they would make into ""smoked"" sausage – but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown. "" (Paragraph 5).  He proceeds to state that all the sausages were the same but some were gabled differently to increase the price.  He also adds that no one pays attention to what goes in the sausage as long as its made. The meatpacking houses wrongly hid the condition of the meat by altering the taste with stronger pickling, smell by rubbing it with soda, color by using different chemicals that were unhealthy, and presentation by either grinding it, hoping it, or whatever else was acceptable.",504,2
2.2937067,1.1540214,d72bca095079,ebad26,"In the novel ""the jungle"" by Upton Sinclair he describes how the meat packing industry worked with the meat. He went on to describe in detail the horrible unsafe, disgusting, and morality wrong crosses that of which the meat was packaged. One thing the industry would do is putting many chemicals into the rotten meat to make it look better so that people would buy it.  As seen in the novel, ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell [...] also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.

This quote shows how the industry would use sut about any means to sell the meat they had even if it ment using unsafe means to change it completely. Such as dropping loads of rotten meat into stubs of singer and leaving it so that it would be more appealing.  In ""The Jungle"" it also states, ""Some of it they would make into ""smoked"" sausage – but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown."" (Sinclair 5). This quote shows one of the many dangerous chemicals they would put in the meat, as borax is a cleaning tool. Batting could lead to death as seen in www.medicalnewstoday.com it states, ""Bora is not safe to invest. According to the LM's Toxicology Data Network, borax is easy for the body to break down when either inhaled or swallowed. However, if inhalation or ingestion occurs, both serious poisoning and organ damage can result.""(Wilson 2019). This quote shows how dangerous it is to invest Bora.",534,2
2.6033401,1.2652111,868796a4397a,ebad26,"The first way the factory would cover up spoiled meat was to put it in sausage. In paragraph one the author writes, ""For it was the custom, as they found, whenever year was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage."" This explains how they would put spoiled meat with fresh meat, instead of throwing the spoiled meat out. If the factory didn't put the spoiled meat in sausage, they would rub it with soda to take away the small, or they would use chemicals to enhance aspects of the meat. From paragraph two it states, ""...how the meat that was taken our of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This explains there use of soda and chemicals to mask the spoiled meat. Next up, the factory would stuff ham with the spoiled meat using a machine and a needle. The text explains in paragraph two, ""... a caching consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled..."" This evidence further describes how they would mask spoiled meat. Finally, once the factory discovered how to take the bone out of a ham, they would insert a white-hot iron, and they would go on to sell ""boneless hams"" or ""California hams"" and fancy ""skinned hams"" which all were filled with spoiled meat. However no one would buy skinned hams, until they were cooked, and chopped up fine, which they then called ""head cheese"". Evidence comes from paragraph two, ""...but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. The packers were always originating such schemes—they had what they called “boneless hams,” which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and “California hams,” which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy “skinned hams,” which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them—that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled “head cheese!” These lines of text explain the procedure that happened to the hams just for them to be sold. If Europe old sausage came back however, no matter how moldy or white it was, the factor would dose it with borax and glycerin and then pack it with fresh meat just to sell again. ",625,2

Ron had created a symbol like the taxi salute to show how  evil they were becoming, but none of the students disobeyed.  At the final stage of the experiment the students who know instead of having 30 members had 200 were so deeply involved in something that was so obviously terrible.

However as a few days went by it went from 30 to 200 people in a quick amount of time.  All of these people listened to Jones and did exactly what he said and they weren't exactly thinking much of it.  When he introduced the salute signal non of the students said no to it and they all did it, ""Jones made up a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class.  They all obeyed this command."" Clearly they replicated what occured with the Nazis without even knowing they were doing it.  This shows how out of hand the experiment got and it could have gotten worse if it was continued.  However Jones thought it was appropriate to end the experiment.  This was because it proved his point of how people willingly create superiority and sometimes without even knowing which could lead to bad things. ",208,3

These teens were so important because they dont have a lot that divides them, they are impressionable, and they don't have anything of their own yet, meaning that they may not be  concerned with the rights of an individual. These traits are so important because it makes it so that the teens won't question the experiment, they won't mind the lack of democracy, and they are easily united under the common goal of strength. With this rapid growth in the organisation the kids were becoming more and more brainwashed because of herd behavior, and the it needed to be ended because something bad could happen.

The main reasoning for terminating the movement was because students became too invested into the experiment and Jones felt it was slipping out of his control to get rid of the experiment he lied to the students by announcing that the third wave was a part of a national wave movement and Jones ordered students to attend a publicly announced presidential candidate of the movement, when the day came they were presented with a blank channel and Jones saw that as an opportunity to announce that they were a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others even when horrible things are happening.",283,3

This lasted only five days because it got very out of control and developed way too fast.  originally, Jones stated he was starting a movement to illuminate democracy. The third wave was a symbol of strength. The movement went from 30 participants to 44 on the first day , he taught the students how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day there were over 200 members. The students were all very loyal to Jones,   ""Jones was surprised that some of the students started reporting to him when other members of the movement failed to abide by the rules"" This was a sign to him that students would do anything for power, and to move up and get superior to other students. He knew something must be done. The  experiment ended because people took this very seriously and they were very loyal to this and this was the students developing ba sense of superiority over one another, he felt it was slipping out of control.  Jones towed the students, ""they had been a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority4 over others, and how this can lead people to justify doing horrible things in the name of the state’s honor"" He felt the experiment growing out of his reach,  he ended it for the sake of the students and their future loyalty to eachother.

2.535505,2.0763853,a04bba18f7d2,814d6b,"The way that the Third Wave experiment developed over the five days that it was exponential; the ending number of participants made the original number pale in comparison to the original number.  The main reason that the experiment was able to grow as fast as it did in the short amount of time that it was active was because of the way that the experiment looked to those outside of it. The author says ""All of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or other tasks to bring honor to the movement,"" (CommonLit 3). It is common knowledge that envy and jealousy are present in every human being, and this must be the reason that so many outside students joined. As described in the quote, there were many things within the experiment that were exclusive of outside students. The students out of the experiment must have felt a desire to join in with the other students, an indirect form of peer pressure, if you will. The experiment was ended early due to its rapidly increasing intensity, and the operator of the experiment feared what would become of it were it to continue, thus he ended it. Jones' fear is expressed in the quote, ""By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control,"" (CommonLit 5). It is clearly expressed that Jones was fearful of the students' increasing intensity and thus decided to end it, especially through the description ""that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.",333,3
2.0720956,2.0248296,11c3509b7b43,814d6b,"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because of how seriously the students reacted to the regime of the Third Wave. After the reading explains what rules were outlined to students, the text states, ""As the week went on, Jones’ class transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community.  [...] This resulted in dramatic improvements to the efficiency, or orderliness, of the class. [...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees"" (CommonLit). This cluster of text routes shows how legitimately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is committing said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighbor's mom told you as a kid: ""If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?""- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe. Birds for example learn to fly, walk, eat, etc. by watching their siblings and following the mother. It is human nature to follow the pack and unfortunately it is not always a benefit to society.

2.704052,2.406061,9ecc3600af3f,814d6b,"The Third Wave started as a experiment only Jones knew was actually one. The students were told it was a new movement, and that it would eliminate democracy. Jones also predicted it would bring more discipline and authority to the class and others in the school. After the first day of the experiment, Jones made it to where the class had to follow strict orders involving discipline and authority. They were told to salute one another outside of class and after three days students from all over the school were joining in. The students showed drastic improvements on academic skills and motivation. The students could stop non-members from entering the class and he instructed them on how to create new members. By the fourth day, the students were showing so much discipline and loyalty that Jones decided it was getting out of control. He made the students attend a rally where he announced that this was an experiment to show how people willingly follow the crowd or create a sense of superior over others leading to horrible things. This experiment developed over such a short period of time because that is what happens when the whole crowd is telling people to support or be a certain way. This happens in real life and only takes a short amount of time since so many people are following one thing or idea and it spreads rapidly. The experiment ended because Jones realized first of all that if the experiment went on any longer it would lead to an authoritarian school and result in something much more than a experiment if it went on. He also noticed that it worked out too perfectly probably and that it was time to go ahead and end the experiment since it was a success already. Jones was also not in control of it really anymore since so many students joined and took authority over it. He knew it was time to bring his main lesson across clearly to all the students at the school instead of continuing what he was against and let it get even more out of control.",376,3
2.74572,2.0336478,e12feeaa31c0,814d6b,"The Third Wave developed in such a short period of time because the students were required to salute other classmates outside of class and saw improvements in grades. In the text, it states that Mr.Jones made the members of his class salute each other, even in his absence. ""Jones made up a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime and ordered class members to salute each other even outside the class. They all obeyed this command."" The students all ended up opening his command as stated, causing the other kids in the school to recognize that students were salting each other. The other students became interested and wanted to join. When they learned that the students who were seen salting each other around the halls were seeing improvements in grades, it gave them another reason to want to join the class. The class had grown by 13 students after only three days. ""The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees."" Mr. Jones recognized this increase and then taught his students how to initiate new members, growing the numbers even more. ""Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day, the movement had over 200 participants. "" The initiation training led to the classes immense growth over such a short period of time, as proved by the quote. By the time the fourth day had rolled around, Mr. Jones felt like he was losing control of the experiment and had to end it. ""...the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control. He decided to terminate the movement..."" Had Mr. Jones not lost his grip on the experiment, perhaps he would have continued it longer as it did show improvements in grades and popularity. Had Mr. Jones not terminated the project, he could have ended up creating the next Nazi Regime on accident. In conclusion, Mr. Jones successfully demonstrated how groups followed the crowd, through the commencement and termination of his experiment The Third Wave.  ",407,3
2.917679,2.129395,74545d29969c,814d6b,"The Third Wave, a five-day experiment conducted by Ron Jones, was created for the history teacher to help his students understand how people in horrific historical events had followed the crowd in the wake of terrible things. He started the experiment small, by inviting students to join a movement title. 'The Third Wave"", which aimed to bring down democracy. The movement stated out small in his classroom, by having kids practice proper seating and abide by strict rules with him as their leader. Jones noticed that as the week went on, students had ""a supreme sense of discipline and community"" (CommonLit Staff) and even followed the Nazi-like salute Jones had made up. By the third day, the movement had tons of students involved all of whom showed, ""a drastic improvement in academic skills and tremendous motivation"" (CommonLit Staff). All members were issued a member card and given a specific task/assignment to honor the movement. As members started to learn how to recruit more people, membership increased to over 200 students. They asked questions in three words or less and preface all their statements with ""Mr.Jones"". By the experiment's fourth day, Jones saw an alarming amount of loyalty and dedication to the movement. So much, that he knew he had to shut it down, before it got out of control. To reveal that the whole movement had been an experiment, Jones convinced his students that a presidential candidate of the nationally-recognized movement was publicly announcing it's existence on T.V., and ordered them all to a noon rally on Friday. When the students got to the rally, all they saw was a blank screen. Jones revealed that they had been part of an experiment to show how quickly people will join a group to prove their superiority over others or have a sense of community no matter the type of community. He also explained how people will excuse any actions as contribution to the movement or classify it for ""the name of the state's honor"" (CommonLit Staff). He had to shut the experiment down because the movement was getting ot of control and people were involving themselves into something that they knew little about. As people started to gain a false sense of confidence in the movement, they excused weird and controlled behaviors in the name of the movement. ",460,3
