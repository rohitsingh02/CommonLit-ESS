A second rule states that the main character must not be a completely good or evil man, but a man who has a few small flaws that lead to disaster. Another very important rule is that the events of the play must progress from good to bad, and it must end terribly for the main character so that those emotions mentioned in rule one are felt clearly.

Turning a tradgey into a funny comegdy is not something people run towards. Most people want to know that how they feel is what others feel as well.

That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a tradegy must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error. That way ,the audience will feel both pity and fear knowing they could have acted similarly. Anything else will not evoke the proper emotions.

Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be relatable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity.

This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up.

Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character\u2019s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good.

As the tragedy progresses, there must be a shift from happiness to misery, ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""

Lastly, an ideal tragedy is must be complex and full of life "" A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Paragraph 2).

Having one problem in a tragedy helps the audience focus on that one problem, and having to many of those can cause the audience to get side tracked easily or get lost on what is happening. A second element that aristotle thinks is important is that the story line should have the actor go from good to bad, and not bad to good. This can help the audience stay involved and not get bored through the story, and it also gives the audience to think aboutor be curious about while they are reading it. The third ans last strategy that Aristotle brings up is that ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frality, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" This means that the character should not exactly be a villan or act evil, but be  make many mistakes and have moral weakness.",208,0

(Paragraph 2) It also should cause shock and make the reader feel either pity or fear of the situation or character and should include a character integral to the story so that the readers are invested enough for the tragedy to surprise them and make them feel emotion. In this passage, it says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. "" (Paragraph 3) which tells the reader that it should be a change that is drastic and shocking.

He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo is not a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which was not a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy. ",217,0
2.1339493,1.9482094,d5841f58a9a2,39c16e,"    According to Aristotle, an ideal tragedy should be developed a certain way. He mentions that the play should be complex and full of different ""characters"" and plots, instead of being simple and straight-forward. The tragedy shoud evoke a sense of pity as well as fear onto the audience over a character who does not move from prosperity to adversity (it is just shocking, not pitiful or fearful) or a character that does not face misfortune when they do not deserve it. Additonally, the swap of fortune should be from good to bad rather than bad to good, resulting in an unhappy ending. This, according to Aristotle, hightens the dramatic reaction to the tragedy. Lastly, Aristotle claims the perfect tragedy should be proper instead of comedic, should have conflict such as relationship changes and characters who are slain, and it should have plot in which is ""double-threaded"". In simpler terms, Aristotle believes the ideal tragedy is complex, has a change in plot from good to bad, and should make the audience feel pity and fear towards the actions against the main character.",218,0

In paragraph two he says a complex plan would be more effective as it will enact emotions. ""A plot of this kind would, doubtless satisfy the moral sense, but inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" (Paragraph 2). In Paragraph three he mentions a well-constructed tragedy to be single rather than double. ""Hense they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."" (Paragraph 3). In Paragraph four he ends the plan with a perfect tragedy saying, It has an opposite catapsphrphe for the good and bad. ""The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies."" (Paragraph 4).",220,0

The creation of pity and fear in the viewers is critical for a play because it is the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" If it instead brings prosperity to adversity, the play does not invoke pity or fear and the result is just shock to the viewer, which is not the intention. A complex plot is also involved in an idealogical tragedy. Tragedies aim to be ""single in tissue, rather than double as maintain."" The plot should also not follow a storyline that goes from bad to good, but actually good to bad.  Lastly, character is another important aspect. Character is usually one that is considered to be a person who is good, but suffers misfortune and even their downfall due to their own judgement, making them very relatable. Usually they are also famous and prosperous, as seen with Oedipus and Thyestes. Therefore, pity and fear, complex plots, and character are all crucial to an idealogical tragedy.",222,0

Another element of an ideal tragedy is the story should be well thought out and much effort should be put into it. ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (p2) meaning that for a story to be the perfect tragedy it should be though through well.  Lastly a tragedy should be on a basis of ""Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes and Telephus"" (P3).

Another ideal thing that a tragedy has is, that the main character shoudld be brought from adversity to prosterity becuase it can end happily, but also sadly at the same time, and it needs to have some action in there and some things to surpise the audience with and not just be stale and boring as the audience is watching or reading the play.

Meaning that the ideal tragedy should c omplex and draw the audience in, and not be simple and boring/to the point.

Evoking pity and fear from an audience are staples to a basic tragedy because such strong emotions practically entice the audience into the story; the audience may be able to see themselves in the story presented. The downfall of the story's villain in a tragedy should not be included because such event would only satisfy the audience and their moral sense. Pity and fear would not come from a villain's downfall because the evil had been defeated for the sake of what is ""good"" in the story. The main character of a tragedy should be balanced because their grey morality in views has the audience wonder if theiractions were deserving of such misfortune. It incites pity for the main character due to the main character not being wholly bad, just that their errors in judgement sadly brought them to misfortune.",227,0

Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it does not incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not depraved; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.

The meathod that the author should take, Artistole suggests, is one where actions of the characters promote feelings of remorse and a little bit of fear for the excitement. Another element Artistole believes is in an ideal tragedy is, ""the downfall of the utter villian be exhibited"" (Artistole, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he should not die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a chracter"" (Artistole, 3). This ultimatly means that the main character, the protagonist, shall do something utterly stupid that worsens his own life.

Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a ""double threat of plot"", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience.

The tragedy must pass feelings of terror and commotion to the public, it should be highly emotional and precise. A tragedy also must have intimate language and actions that engage the readers and excite pity and fear. The language and actions bring different ambiances and excitement throughout. The language should be pleasant and easily understood by the audience. A tragedy must have true tragic endings and not resemble comedies. An example of a comedy, not a tragedy is when those who are enemies leave the stage as friends at the end, and no one kills or is killed. It is overused and cliche.

Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Aristotle 3).

When a tradegey exites pity and fear, it usually starts with a change of fortune. In the text it says, ""... that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" This part merely shocks the audience. Finally, a tragic hero is a man that is not bad but not perfect. There is always an error of judgement or flaw.

Aristotle overall scopes the plot of perfect tragedy by revealing that the  character must be one of prestige.

In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Oedipus, Orestes, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune.

Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.

A complex plan of a plot is extremly important in order to have an ideal tradgedy.  The plot must move from the begining to the end according to a cramped sequence of events that are to happen.  Furthermore, another element to an ideal plot is charecter.  ""Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses \u2014 on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible"".  A plot should consist of a charceter going from joy to misery as the plot progresses.  A final element in order to form a perfect tradegdy is thought.

He then goes on to say that by what method will the specific affect of tragedy be proudced  throughout the plot. The character is another form of ideal tragedy. The character that is not successful, or  ""good and just"" will also be the charcter who is not a bad person but is judged because of some ""error"" or past situation that is now defined as his reputation. Instances like that in movies are predictable which does not make them tragedies anymore. The last ideal tragedy is spectacle. The spectacle part of tragedy refers to how things are seen. Such as characters, the set up of the movie or play, how they dress and sound and other things along that line. Spectacle can occur in tragedy because everything is not as it seems. The way the characters dress act and sound could cover up their true identies. With that being said the people would not expect the nice sweet guy to be the mass murderer of the play.

The second element of a good tragety would the progress from good to bad fortune throughout the story.  A tragety is not a tragety if the protagonist has a happy ending because it just is not tragic. In order for the story to be tragic there needs to be a great amount of misery and woe involving the protagonist having the good things in life take from them throughout the span of the story. The third element of a good tragety is an unhappy ending. If the story ends happily for the protagonist then the story is not at all sad or tragic.

It should not just be a normal, predictable story from start to finish, it should have multiple components. An example of a simple, non complex story would be an average man going from very poor to very rich. According to the text, ""... the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity.""  This si too predictable, and does not satisfy the reader.  Secondly,  a perfect tragedy should include a man who is not necesarily good or bad, but he makes a mistake that causes his downfall. The text says ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement ."" In this case, readers can empathize with the man in the story, in addition to fufilling the moral sense.  Lastly, the change of fourtune for the main character should be good to bad.  This is directly stated in the text ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Again, this misfortune for the character is due to an error, so it is very relatable to readers. ",256,0
2.135635,1.7271247,102c9b9dad7c,39c16e,"Three elements that make a tragedy ideal include being based on a complex plan,  a highly prosperous, average main character, and an unmerited issue. Aristotle writes that ""A perfect tragedy...not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This shows that a good tragedy must be complex if it is to rise above others. Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned..."" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned. Finally, Aristotle states ""...pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves."" Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune befall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate. In the world, no one knows what fate has in store, and this specific setting easily allows audience members to imagine themselves as the main character.

In this passage,  Aristotle outlines the faults in some so called ""tragedies,"" and what caused others to succeed. The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed. As the focus on this one mediocre man, they should not be taken on tangents that stray from the one main topic of the story of this man. A tragedy written to please the readers like The Odyssey, oftentimes more resembles the plot of a comedy than a tragedy. We have been able to infer from this article that a good tragedy follows at least 3 very important elements, 1) it follows the story of a neither good nor evil man, 2) it has many events of sadness and none of success 3) it follows one main plotline that would not be easily confused with that of another genre.

By this, he means that a tragedy should make the audience feel a lot of different emotions but mostly pity and fear. They should pity the main character but also fear them because they will eventually become bad. Another element he highlights is a lapse in judgment, he writes, ""\u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,5 but by some error of judgment or frailty."". One man cannot be good nor bad but simply make a mistake. A good tragedy is when the man is just a normal person who takes the wrong turn or makes a deadly mistake that results in a series of alarming events. The final element he discusses is an unhappy ending.  Aristotle explains, ""many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."". Tragedies should end unhappily. The essence of a tragedy is not to get a happy ending or to have everything resolved it is just simply to end. They are very realistic pieces of literature and having a happy ending would only ruin the emotions set out throughout the entire play.",257,0

While the primary character or the hero within these pieces should be an individual which is situated between the two extremes of incredibly just an incredibly evil, they should be neither be the epitome of saintly and good while they should neither have their downfall be brought to them due to their depravity or vice which they possess and should instead occur due to their own frailty or a minute error of judgment or mistake, and they should be an individual which is both prosperous and renowned being well known and plentiful within their lives or be other individuals connected to families which are of this variety. As well as that the plot which is maintained by these works should possess a singular issue or complication which it is revolving around, and the alteration within the character's fortune should be from that of good to poor and it should not occur due to a vice they possess and instead due to an error within the character previously described or one which is even better than that, though never worse, and within these pieces, there is what people call a bad or unhappy ending.",285,0

Aristotle  believes that the goal of a tragedy is to ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and argues that in order for the tragedy to accomplish this goal, it should feature the downfall of a hero ""who is neiter eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought on not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" He thinks that if the hero were purely good, his downfall would simply be shocking to the audience, whereas the downfall of a purely evil man would not arouse pity or fear, since ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" and the audience would instead derive moral satisfaction from seeing the evil man get what he deserved. Finally, Aristotle writes that while a tragedy should ""be arranged not only the simple but on the complex plan"" but that there should not be a ""double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and bad"" because in that case the sense of pleasure from the audience will not be ""true tragic pleasure"" but closer to what the audience would feel when watching a comedy.",304,0
2.3224523,1.457408,26e11646cf98,39c16e,"Aristotle describes many elements that should be included in a tragedy in On Tragedy.

He goes on to explain how the audience will feel pity or fear- by portraying a protagonist who is not particularly good or evil, just an ordinary person who falls into misfortune. Second, Aristotle claims that a good tragedy should have a suitable plot that is not too complicated and in which the fortune turns from good to bad because of the characters' actions. He establishes this in the third paragraph: ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.

2.3592815,1.9987555,1acf92125772,39c16e,"Three of the main elements of a great tragedy are as follows: actions that incite pity and fear, a change of fortune from good to bad, and the exclusion of the utter downfall of the villian. Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story will not have the necessary components.

2.6036856,2.0135252,f5154ae8d89c,39c16e,"The first element of an ideal tragedy is that there should be a complex plan rather than a simple plan. According to the text, Aristotle states that ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (para 2). This would mean that an ideal tragedy would essentially evoke extreme emotions, like pity or fear from the audience, but not merely indicate a change in fortune of a person from good to bad that does not cause any significant reaction from the audience. The second element of a tragedy, as mentioned, there should be a reversal in fate going from good to bad and not from bad to good. An additional detail should include the idea that the misfortune causing a person to go from ""prosperity to adversity"" (para 2) should be ""unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like oursleves"" (para 2). This means that the misfortune should be in a manner that the person suffering the misfortune does not necessarily deserve it. Only then is it thought that pity or fear will be evoked to be considered as an ideal or effective tragedy. The third element of an ideal tragedy is the misfotrune coming about due to ""some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse"" (para 3). This would mean that there should be some error either caused by the person receiving the misfortune or by the part of some surrounding error.

2.6773994,2.082029,1b82ce4967e9,39c16e,"One of the elements Aristotle claims is crucial to constructing an ideal tragedy is the emphasis on building a story out of pity and misfortune. As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narritive as it progresses. Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses \u2014 on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.""

2.6371505,2.6728365,57d4aad66e97,39c16e,"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they have made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that has / that is because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary).

Though he stresses many ideas, they all fall into general elements that must be included, which includes the actions must spark pity and fear, the change in fortune should be from good to bad, and this shift should not be due to one's bad habits rather from an error of judgment or frailty. Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and reshapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character cannot be a villain because this would not be a tragedy and the person could not be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit. Aristotle made the elements of tragedy, expressing pity and fear, making sure it was good to bad, and that it was not a normal error of the person rather bad judgment, clear through his writing.",343,0

Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous..."" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness. This is truly defined as a tragedy because of  how these types of common endings surprise the audience as it might be something unexpected.",346,0

Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it would not invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it would not be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character should not be too good, as this would not invoke any pity, however, the character also should not be too evil, or else the audience would not feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character.

2.8695192,2.8772964,3971e6ab3679,39c16e,"    3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle includes a well-contructed plot, a tragedy arranged on a complex plan, and it needs to bring emotion from readers. Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an ""end unhappily. It is... the right ending."" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satifies ""the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear."" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when ""some great error or frailty"" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it has / it is similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be. However, Aristotle wants to make it more known that a short story can be constructed in an emotionally compelling way part of which still applies even in modern times.",366,0
2.5244584,2.1730647,32f23f665431,39c16e,"According to this reading, Aristotle views the concept of an ideal tragedy by using elements of six different parts, but the most important according to him, are elements of plot, character, and thought. First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate. ",368,0
2.6392362,2.4024312,888abfac4dc6,39c16e,"As described by Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is one that effectively voices it plot through a single lense from which is complex and venturing out into different perspectives instead of and rather than being clear and concise and simplistic to a certain degree. This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgence of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortunate actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""",375,0
2.6583989,2.224231,25e459261b79,39c16e,"Aristotle was one the smartest philosopher's at this time and had many opinions on how a tragedy should be written. Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be relatable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charcter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more relatable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies \u2014 like Orestes and Aegisthus \u2014 quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'. This is what Aristotle charcterized Greek tragedies by during his time as a philosopher.",406,0
2.6517146,1.6709548,8a72454de3e0,39c16e,"At least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle are having characters that the audience can relate to, a well constructed plot brought about by an error, and they follow a true tragic ending. When discussing a tragic character, Aristolte states that it is important to have a character that the audience can relate to. He does this when he says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" He states that it is important to have a character with these traits because it arouses fear and pity in the audience. He states this throughout paragraph two when he says ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This takes away from a true tragedy because in the end, the protagonist must face their downfall. ",436,0
2.3455064,1.3890462,66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",489,0
3.2705605,2.4030995,8d9cd2ec20cb,39c16e,"Three elements of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle are a well constructed plot, a character's soul, as well as the production/performance. The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, "" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arouse both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becomming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the mistrtune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a ""spectacle,"" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience. ",616,0
3.7474313,2.8901148,574369ff8f20,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy must have a relateable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" it has / it is imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they are not / am not bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. it has / it is essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies \u2014 like Orestes and Aegisthus \u2014 quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",758,0
