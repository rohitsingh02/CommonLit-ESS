The second element of an ideal tragedy is that the emotions and experiences had by the character must appear relatable to the reader as these are the precise emotions that a tragedy aims to make the reader feel.  By allowing the reader to actually feel tragedy they are left with the emotions of a tragic conclusion which brings me to the final aspect of an ideal tragedy.  The final element of a proper tragedy is that the conclusion must remain tragic; meaning that the character must not see his conditions reverse.

Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be relatable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity. A third element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should not resemble a comedy. A tragedy has to be serious, in order for the audience to feel fear, pity, and slight sympathy towards a character. Comedic feelings would cancel out the feelings of fear and pity which would harm the true meaning of a tragedy. ",201,0

The characters in a tragedy should also not start from a spot of despair and work towards success. While a basic development from fortune to adversity would also not be ideal for a tragedy, adding more complexity to this story and including aspects that encourage fear or pity would contribute to developing an ideal tragedy. The construction of how the characters reach their final downfall is also a significant element of an ideal tragedy.

That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a tradegy must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error.

Another element of an ideal tragedy that Aristotle described is that the tragic hero should be someone well-known and successful. Aristotle uses the examples of Oedipus and Thyestes because both are of royal descent, helping to once again get across the feeling of fear by showing the reader that someone so fortunate may not always be so lucky. Finally, a feature that Aristotle mentioned that should be included in order to create an ideal tragedy would be that the character\u2019s fortune should go from good to bad as opposed to it going from bad to good.

The protagonist begins the story with good luck, then ends it with bad luck (and vice versa, in the antagonist's case). The most vital aspect of a tragedy is its ending. Tragedies must end unhappily. The hero must suffer a horrible ending and the villain is encouraged to prosper (or at least to win).

To imitate fear or pity it must have a dramatic event that causes many emotions in the audience ""It should, moreover, imitate actions white excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of a tragic imitation"" (Paragraph 2). It also has to include a well-known person, they can be either hated or loved ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous- a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families"" (Paragraph 2). Lastly, an ideal tragedy is must be complex and full of life "" A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Paragraph 2).

He clearly states in paragraph three, ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" The second element is having a character who is between two extremes, not extremely good and fair, but doesn't do immoral or evil actions to cause misfortune to himself. In paragraph two Aristotle states, ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity..."" The third element is having actions ""which excite pity and fear."" Aristotle explains that we should avoid three types of plots which do not excite pity and fear. We should avoid a person going from prosperity to adversity, adversity to prosperity, and a bad man going from prosperity to adveristy because these plots do not not seem fearful or pitiable.",216,0
1.4775997,1.8875852,eadfbab27103,39c16e,"There are many elements to an ideal tragedy according to ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle. To begin with, character is a big element in order to achieve an ideal tragedy. Aristotle talks about how a character should not be a bad man or virtuos man, but a man in between those two extremes. A man who is not eminently good and just, yet their downfall is caused byerror of judgement or frailty. Some examples are Oedupis or Thyestes. This is because they are relatable to the viewers and pity or excitement can not be aroused  from simple adversity to prosperity or prosperity to adversity. Another key element is the plot. It should be a single plot where change of fortune should be from good to bad. Some of the greatest tragedies like the fortunes of Oedipus or Alcmaeon can back this up. Lastly, the ending is also a major facet of the ideal tragedy. Although the ending may not satisfy the viewers, if done right, it can be the most tragic like Euripides.",220,0
1.7818758,2.265756,d5841f58a9a2,39c16e,"    According to Aristotle, an ideal tragedy should be developed a certain way. He mentions that the play should be complex and full of different ""characters"" and plots, instead of being simple and straight-forward. The tragedy shoud evoke a sense of pity as well as fear onto the audience over a character who does not move from prosperity to adversity (it is just shocking, not pitiful or fearful) or a character that does not face misfortune when they do not deserve it. Additonally, the swap of fortune should be from good to bad rather than bad to good, resulting in an unhappy ending. This, according to Aristotle, hightens the dramatic reaction to the tragedy. Lastly, Aristotle claims the perfect tragedy should be proper instead of comedic, should have conflict such as relationship changes and characters who are slain, and it should have plot in which is ""double-threaded"". In simpler terms, Aristotle believes the ideal tragedy is complex, has a change in plot from good to bad, and should make the audience feel pity and fear towards the actions against the main character.",223,0
1.6948745,2.439379,1ec6c7f88443,39c16e,"           Aristotle believes there are certain elements that come together to produce an ideal tragedy. He believes the character who commits the tragic flaw should be a fair character who is well known, and should be not a great nor terrible person. For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villian or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy. ",226,0

The creation of pity and fear in the viewers is critical for a play because it is the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" If it instead brings prosperity to adversity, the play doesn't invoke pity or fear and the result is just shock to the viewer, which is not the intention. A complex plot is also involved in an idealogical tragedy. Tragedies aim to be ""single in tissue, rather than double as maintain."" The plot should also not follow a storyline that goes from bad to good, but actually good to bad.  Lastly, character is another important aspect. Character is usually one that is considered to be a person who is good, but suffers misfortune and even their downfall due to their own judgement, making them very relatable. Usually they are also famous and prosperous, as seen with Oedipus and Thyestes. Therefore, pity and fear, complex plots, and character are all crucial to an idealogical tragedy.",233,0

In paragraph two he says a complex plan would be more effective as it will enact emotions. ""A plot of this kind would, doubtless satisfy the moral sense, but inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" (Paragraph 2). In Paragraph three he mentions a well-constructed tragedy to be single rather than double. ""Hense they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."" (Paragraph 3). In Paragraph four he ends the plan with a perfect tragedy saying, It has an opposite catapsphrphe for the good and bad. ""The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure.

Another ideal thing that a tragedy has is, that the main character shoudld be brought from adversity to prosterity becuase it can end happily, but also sadly at the same time, and it needs to have some action in there and some things to surpise the audience with and not just be stale and boring as the audience is watching or reading the play.

Evoking pity and fear from an audience are staples to a basic tragedy because such strong emotions practically entice the audience into the story; the audience may be able to see themselves in the story presented. The downfall of the story's villain in a tragedy should not be included because such event would only satisfy the audience and their moral sense. Pity and fear would not come from a villain's downfall because the evil had been defeated for the sake of what is ""good"" in the story. The main character of a tragedy should be balanced because their grey morality in views has the audience wonder if theiractions were deserving of such misfortune.

Some examples of elements in an ideal tragedy made by Arisotle are, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" Meaning that the ideal tragedy should c omplex and draw the audience in, and not be simple and boring/to the point.  ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" This meaning, that it should ignite something within thne audience and bring about emotions of sorrow or longing to the character or characters.

This means that the story follows the actions and resolution of the main character only, and focuses on the character's change of fortune froom good to bad. Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not depraved; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.  When the audience sees a tragic event occur to a plausible character because of a mistake or slight misfortune, the feeling of tragedy is heightened because it seems more true.",238,0

First, Aristotle explains that ""a perfect tragedy should be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"". (Aristotle 2). Aristotle continues by suggesting that the tragedy should ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and calls this the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle 2). This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle's second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4). Lastly, the author states that the ideal tragedy ""should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (Aristotle 3).

He starts out by describing actions, ""...excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Artistole, 2). The meathod that the author should take, Artistole suggests, is one where actions of the characters promote feelings of remorse and a little bit of fear for the excitement. Another element Artistole believes is in an ideal tragedy is, ""the downfall of the utter villian be exhibited"" (Artistole, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villian, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfourtune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should posess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a chracter"" (Artistole, 3). This ultimatly means that the main character, the protagonist, shall do something utterly stupid that worsens his own life. This truly would be depressing as the audience would want to see the protagonist grow in his life which goes from bad to good instead of good to bad. ",242,0
1.7056223,1.8374023,237657cb7563,39c16e,"According to Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is that it should incite feelings of pity and fear within us. Aristotle believes that a good tragedy doesn't just show for the spectacle, but truly makes us feel for the characters, and incites those feelings of pity and fear.  As Aristotle states, ""It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear."" Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a ""double threat of plot"", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience. A true poet doesn't write just based on the wishes of the audience and because of that misses the true tragic pleasure of an ideal tragedy.",243,0

Second, he states in paragraph 3, ""Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses - on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible."" This quote shows how the best tragedies focus on characters who were greatly affected by the tragedy, which makes it have a great plot. Lastly, in paragraph 3 he also states ""The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition,"" which shows how diction and performance on the stage brings it to life and really makes it a great tragedy.

The plot of an ideal tragedy is a man that is neither good nor evil whose life falls apart because of a mistake. The tragedy must pass feelings of terror and commotion to the public, it should be highly emotional and precise. A tragedy also must have intimate language and actions that engage the readers and excite pity and fear. The language and actions bring different ambiances and excitement throughout. The language should be pleasant and easily understood by the audience. A tragedy must have true tragic endings and not resemble comedies. An example of a comedy, not a tragedy is when those who are enemies leave the stage as friends at the end, and no one kills or is killed. It is overused and cliche. A tragedy must have death, successes, losses, and different feelings so people can become engaged and feel the emotions.

The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a relatable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.

When a tradegey exites pity and fear, it usually starts with a change of fortune. In the text it says, ""... that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" This part merely shocks the audience. Finally, a tragic hero is a man that is not bad but not perfect. There is always an error of judgement or flaw.

The character that is not successful, or  ""good and just"" will also be the charcter who isn't a bad person but is judged because of some ""error"" or past situation that is now defined as his reputation. Instances like that in movies are predictable which doesn't make them tragedies anymore. The last ideal tragedy is spectacle. The spectacle part of tragedy refers to how things are seen. Such as characters, the set up of the movie or play, how they dress and sound and other things along that line. Spectacle can occur in tragedy because everything isn't as it seems.

In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Oedipus, Orestes, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune.

The second element of a good tragety would the progress from good to bad fortune throughout the story.  A tragety isn't a tragety if the protagonist has a happy ending because it just isn't tragic. In order for the story to be tragic there needs to be a great amount of misery and woe involving the protagonist having the good things in life take from them throughout the span of the story. The third element of a good tragety is an unhappy ending. If the story ends happily for the protagonist then the story is not at all sad or tragic. We as people prefer to have a story end happily for the protagonist because it sits with us better.

He describes this as, ""That of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity""(22-23).

It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies \u2014 like Orestes and Aegisthus \u2014 quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" (Artistole) Artistole decribes why a perfect tragedy can't be truly perfect without tragedy.",268,0

Aristotle writes that ""A perfect tragedy...not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This shows that a good tragedy must be complex if it is to rise above others. Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned..."" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned. Finally, Aristotle states ""...pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves."" Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune befall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate. In the world, no one knows what fate has in store, and this specific setting easily allows audience members to imagine themselves as the main character.

In this passage,  Aristotle outlines the faults in some so called ""tragedies,"" and what caused others to succeed. The entire point of tragedy is to invoke a deep and true feeling of pity or sadness in the reader, something they can relate to on some level. a man going from rich to poor does not invoke these feelings, and neither does a man going from rags to riches. Villians falling and heroes rising cause opposite emotions than what is to be striven for in a tragedy, so a true tragedy has to have a merely ok character, usually with a moral compass that is skewed. As the focus on this one mediocre man, they shouldn't be taken on tangents that stray from the one main topic of the story of this man. A tragedy written to please the readers like The Odyssey, oftentimes more resembles the plot of a comedy than a tragedy. We have been able to infer from this article that a good tragedy follows at least 3 very important elements, 1) it follows the story of a neither good nor evil man, 2) it has many events of sadness and none of success 3) it follows one main plotline that wouldn't be easily confused with that of another genre.

One of these is that a tragedy is complicated and heightens emotions such as remorse and fright as in the reader as the plot moves along.  Aristotle concludes, ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""  To summarize, 3 elements of a tragedy from Aristotle are strong emotions stirring in a reader, the defeat of a major character or events in the plot, and one plotline that strictly follows the issue of this story until the tragic ending.",274,0

By this, he means that a tragedy should make the audience feel a lot of different emotions but mostly pity and fear. They should pity the main character but also fear them because they will eventually become bad. Another element he highlights is a lapse in judgment, he writes, ""\u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,5 but by some error of judgment or frailty."". One man cannot be good nor bad but simply make a mistake. A good tragedy is when the man is just a normal person who takes the wrong turn or makes a deadly mistake that results in a series of alarming events. The final element he discusses is an unhappy ending.  Aristotle explains, ""many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."". Tragedies should end unhappily. The essence of a tragedy is not to get a happy ending or to have everything resolved it is just simply to end.

(Paragraph 2) As shown, the elements that make up the tragedy must contain moments of ""pity and fear"", to be recognized as a true tragedy. Also, the tragedy should arise from a mistake or error from the main character. The tragedy should, ""come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

Aristotle believed that the character needed to have a change of fortune which he believed should be from good to bad and it needed to be because of himself.

While the primary character or the hero within these pieces should be an individual which is situated between the two extremes of incredibly just an incredibly evil, they should be neither be the epitome of saintly and good while they should neither have their downfall be brought to them due to their depravity or vice which they possess and should instead occur due to their own frailty or a minute error of judgment or mistake, and they should be an individual which is both prosperous and renowned being well known and plentiful within their lives or be other individuals connected to families which are of this variety. As well as that the plot which is maintained by these works should possess a singular issue or complication which it is revolving around, and the alteration within the character's fortune should be from that of good to poor and it should not occur due to a vice they possess and instead due to an error within the character previously described or one which is even better than that, though never worse, and within these pieces, there is what people call a bad or unhappy ending.",298,0
2.197964,1.8378837,26e11646cf98,39c16e,"Aristotle describes many elements that should be included in a tragedy in On Tragedy.

He goes on to explain how the audience will feel pity or fear- by portraying a protagonist who is not particularly good or evil, just an ordinary person who falls into misfortune. Second, Aristotle claims that a good tragedy should have a suitable plot that is not too complicated and in which the fortune turns from good to bad because of the characters' actions. He establishes this in the third paragraph: ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.

It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.

The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure"". Those are three of the elements that Aristotle says should be in an ideal tragedy.",312,0

Aristotle  believes that the goal of a tragedy is to ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and argues that in order for the tragedy to accomplish this goal, it should feature the downfall of a hero ""who is neiter eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought on not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" He thinks that if the hero were purely good, his downfall would simply be shocking to the audience, whereas the downfall of a purely evil man would not arouse pity or fear, since ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" and the audience would instead derive moral satisfaction from seeing the evil man get what he deserved. Finally, Aristotle writes that while a tragedy should ""be arranged not only the simple but on the complex plan"" but that there should not be a ""double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and bad"" because in that case the sense of pleasure from the audience will not be ""true tragic pleasure"" but closer to what the audience would feel when watching a comedy.",318,0
1.9151523,1.8215827,1acf92125772,39c16e,"Three of the main elements of a great tragedy are as follows: actions that incite pity and fear, a change of fortune from good to bad, and the exclusion of the utter downfall of the villian. Aritsotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to befall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good tradegy, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villian dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components.

The second element of a tragedy, as mentioned, there should be a reversal in fate going from good to bad and not from bad to good. An additional detail should include the idea that the misfortune causing a person to go from ""prosperity to adversity"" (para 2) should be ""unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like oursleves"" (para 2). This means that the misfortune should be in a manner that the person suffering the misfortune does not necessarily deserve it. Only then is it thought that pity or fear will be evoked to be considered as an ideal or effective tragedy. The third element of an ideal tragedy is the misfotrune coming about due to ""some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse"" (para 3).

When Aristole says this, he means that there should be actions that entertain pity, fear, and bring in the ""tragic"" part of the writing. There has to be a bundle of emotions to make the audience feel a certain way for the character. In the chapter from Poetics, Aristotle also states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issure, rather than double as some maintain"" (Paragraph 3).

If you write the ending in the audiences wishes, they will be more intrigued. It's in the best wishes that the poet ends the writing in the audiences wishes, it will result in pleasure.

2.3549194,2.6246529,57d4aad66e97,39c16e,"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and empathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy. ",352,0
2.2599432,2.2983563,5319cec5a6d6,39c16e,"Aristotle made clear many elements that need to be present to construct an ideal tragedy.

Aristotle wrote, ""it should moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). He not only states that it should create the feeling of pity and fear, but also states that these two feelings are distinctive marks of tragedies. This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and reshapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit. Aristotle made the elements of tragedy, expressing pity and fear, making sure it was good to bad, and that it wasn't a normal error of the person rather bad judgment, clear through his writing.",363,0

Here he states that the tragedy should show complex characters with a complex storyline so the audience can feel different emotions that should be felt in a tragedy, such as pity and fear. The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa. For example, in paragraph 2, Aristotle states, ""...here remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous..."" Throughout the paragraph Aristotle shows that a character should fall in between good and evil, which in turn can evoke more emotion in the audience rather than merely being shocked. The third element of a tragedy is that the complex storyline and plot should have the character's fortune go from good to bad, because of a greater mistake created. Aristotle continues to mention this throughout paragraph 3 as the ending should always be in misfortune or unhappiness. This is truly defined as a tragedy because of  how these types of common endings surprise the audience as it might be something unexpected.",368,0

Next, Artistotle exclaims that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be relatable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil pasts. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses \u2014 on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Oedipus, Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.""

Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an ""end unhappily. It is... the right ending."" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satifies ""the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear."" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when ""some great error or frailty"" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it's similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be. However, Aristotle wants to make it more known that a short story can be constructed in an emotionally compelling way part of which still applies even in modern times.",371,0
2.3163028,2.1645722,32f23f665431,39c16e,"According to this reading, Aristotle views the concept of an ideal tragedy by using elements of six different parts, but the most important according to him, are elements of plot, character, and thought. First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate. ",373,0
1.8849423,2.074419,eb76bd210a89,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy, as summarized by Aristotle, is that there should be a serious change in circumstances of the main character, specifically a change from good circumstances to bad, instead of bad to good. Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty."" Essentially, Aristotle is saying that the main character shouldn't be too good, as this wouldn't invoke any pity, however, the character also shouldn't be too evil, or else the audience wouldn't feel sorry for him and his bad misfortune. Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behaviror. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse."" Overall, Aristotle argues that a good tragedy should portray a character who is neither good nor bad, but rather somewhere in the middle, who experiences a change of fortune from good to bad due to some inherent flaw of his character.

2.6181357,2.4893057,888abfac4dc6,39c16e,"As described by Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is one that effectively voices it plot through a single lense from which is complex and venturing out into different perspectives instead of and rather than being clear and concise and simplistic to a certain degree. This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgence of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortunate actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""",394,0
2.3080392,2.2629924,25e459261b79,39c16e,"Aristotle was one the smartest philosopher's at this time and had many opinions on how a tragedy should be written. Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be relatable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charcter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more relatable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies \u2014 like Orestes and Aegisthus \u2014 quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'. This is what Aristotle charcterized Greek tragedies by during his time as a philosopher.",424,0
2.4812315,1.8870183,8a72454de3e0,39c16e,"At least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle are having characters that the audience can relate to, a well constructed plot brought about by an error, and they follow a true tragic ending. When discussing a tragic character, Aristolte states that it is important to have a character that the audience can relate to. He does this when he says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" He states that it is important to have a character with these traits because it arouses fear and pity in the audience. He states this throughout paragraph two when he says ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This takes away from a true tragedy because in the end, the protagonist must face their downfall. ",458,0
2.1968203,1.6377381,66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Diction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisifing moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",520,0
2.9492495,2.4810295,8d9cd2ec20cb,39c16e,"Three elements of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle are a well constructed plot, a character's soul, as well as the production/performance. The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, "" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arouse both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becomming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the mistrtune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a ""spectacle,"" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience. ",624,0
3.1754644,3.0387483,574369ff8f20,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy must have a relateable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes \u2014 that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageously and comedically evil that succeeds because of their malevolence, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audiene will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphance when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have relateable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous \u2014 a personage like Oedipus, Thyestes, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies \u2014 like Orestes and Aegisthus \u2014 quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",781,0

The top of the social structure was the gods or pharos and the pharos were treated like gods because people thought of them like gods in human forms and they controlled everything about Egypt and when they died there was pyrimids and tombs made for them to remember them. At the bottem of the social class was the slaves and farmers. They worked on land and had to psy taxes with grain to the pharos and they had to work hard. And there was the middle class with the craftsmen and merchents and other people. In Egypt the pharos controlled the laws and the government and everything but it was hard for him to do everything so there were priest and nobles to help and they kept records and they ran the government and there were knights who took part too. The knights watched the slaves and farmers all the time when they were building temples or farming to make sure that they were working. Everyone in the egyption social class works and they all have a role.,227,1

The pharaohs also had to take the taxes of farmers. The next social class were nobles and preists. Nobles held government posts. They had tributes paid to the pharaoh aswell. The preists were responsible for pleasing the gods. Nobles were wealthy from the donations to the gods. Next we have the soldiers. Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings.  When there was peace, soldiers supervised peasants, farmers,  and slaves who built structures. Physicians and craftsmen were the middle class. They made jewelry, pottery, papyrus, tools, and other products. There were merchants and storekeepers who sold these products. Finally, the last social class were slaves and farmers. The slaves built pyramids or other structures. Farmers tended fields, raised animals, kept canals, reservoirs, worked in the stone quarries, and built royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes with grain.  Everyone on the social class pyramid had jobs. They were all busy people. Even the top of the pyramid had important jobs.",228,1

In the text it states, ""in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh."" as well as ""Nobles enjoyed great status and also grew wealthy from donations to the gods."". From this it shows that both nobles and priests are very high in status (although not as high as Pharaohs) and both recieve great sums of money. After them comes skilled workers, women, and merchants who make up the middle class and they create goods and provide services for the entirety of the society.

Scribes were also at the same levels as viziers they were important because they knew how to read and write.  Underneath them are nobles and priests. In the text, it states that ""Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods"" which was important because they thought that all their successes were only possible with luck and help from the gods.

The male servants also worked on royal building projects or were sent to fight in the Egyptian army. Egyptian servants did not have many rights but were usually not treated poorly. Egyptian servants could not own or inherit land. Slaves were very important in ancient Egypt as a big part of the labor force, but they were also used for many other purposes.

The pharaoh was connected to the government, because he of she was the ruler of Egypt, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were blieved to be gods in human form"" (paragraph, 2). The pharaohs were thought of as gods and godessess, they were thought of as walking gods. The Middle class was connected to the government because they either helped the pharaoh directly, or they had sustainable jobs to sell things to people, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tribute paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods... Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces"" (paragraph, 6 and 8). The nobles and soldiers held the Middle class, because they weren't as wealthy as the pharaohs, but they had more money than the peasants, farmers, and slaves. The Lower class was connected to the government, because their jobs paid for their homes and food, ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toild at the discretion of the pharaohs or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest- that's a lot of hay!"" (paragraph, 11 and 12). All of the pieces of social structure were connected to the government, they were either the government, or they had to pay the government. The Ancient Egyptian government was not very different from ours today.",498,1

To start off, at the top were the gods, like Ra, Osiris, and Isis stated on paragraph 1. Pharaoh's were the next and egyptians believed Pharaoh's were gods but in human forms and they had absolute power over their subjects which is stated on paragraph 2. The pharaoh directed an army  in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict stated on paragraph 3. All laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh. Each farmer paid taxes in the form of grains, which were stored in the pharaoh's warehouses. This grain was used to feed the people in the event of a famine stated on paragraph 3.  The pharaoh appointed a cheif minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected stated on paragraph 4. Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employess had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt, they could read and write stated on paragraph 5. Below pharaoh's were nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts, which in these positions they profited from tributes, paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods stated on paragraph 6. Soliders fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soilders also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building structures like pyramids and palaces stated on paragraph 8. Skilled workers like physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, and other useful things stated on paragraph 9.  There were people that needed to buy goods from artisians and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public stated on paragraph 10.  At the bottom of the social structure were the slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. Being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles stated on paragraph 11. Farmers tended the fields. raised animals, kept canals, and reservoirs in good order, worked in stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could do as much as 60% of their yearly harvest stated on paragraph 12. Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades.  These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on a gain employment in the government stated on paragraph 13.  That is how the system of Ancient Egypt worked. ",546,1
2.7506642,2.628094,43001fcbea5e,3b9047,"The structure of the ancient Egyptian system of goverment has five different social classes.  The first class, and the highest of them, is the pharoh.  The pharoh is the leader of the area and was beleived to be human gods, the pharoh had responsibilities like protecting Egypt.  In the third paragraph, it states "" Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. ""  This qoute explains the Egyptians beliefs and why the pharohs were leaders.   The second highest, were the powerful nobles and priets.  The nobles held the goverment posts, while the priests were responsible with pleasing the gods.  In the sixth paragraph, it sites that ""Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods.""  This qoute explains what the preists and nobles did and it shows their importance.  Physicians and craftsmen/women were in the middle class.  They made and sold jewerly, pottery, papyrus products and some other useful and wanted objects.  In paragraph nine it states that ""Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things.""  This helps explain their job which is why they were in  the middle class.  Below the middle class is the merchants and storekeepers.  Their job was selling goods the the public.  In the tenth paragraph, the author states that ""These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public.""  This qoute helps explain what their jobs were,  In the bottom class,  they had the slaves and farmers.  The slaves jobs were to follow orders, work on building projects.  In the eleventh paragraph, it states that "" Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles.""  This qoute helps explain my answer because it states what work slaves had to do.  The farmers job was to tend fields, raise animals, kept canals, and more.  In the twelveth paragraph, the author mentions that ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest\u2014that\u2019s a lot of hay!""  This qoute helps explain my answer because it explains what the farmers do for a living.  The better the job you had for a living, the higher you would be on the System of Goverment pyramid.

2.8781435,2.6134224,4aac0bb1600f,3b9047,"Ancient Egypt's system of government is different from what ours is like today. At the top of Egypt's system of government, is the gods. The gods were at the top because the Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the world. In the text it states, ""Egyptians believed that the gods controlled the universe."" The quote from the text shows that the gods were in charge. Next, on the system of government was the pharoahs. The pharaohs had lots of power. The text says, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form. They had absolute power over their subjects."" The quote shows that the pharoahs had a lot of controll. The pharaohs also directed the army in case of a conflict. According to the text, ""The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. "" The quote shows they had power. Then, below the pharoahs were the nobles and the priests.  The nobles held government posts, and the priests were responsible for pleasing gods. In the text it says, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Next, were the vizers. The vizers ensured that all taxes were collected. The text says, ""The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" The quote above shows that the vizers had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.Also, the scribes worked with the vizers. The scribes kept government records. They could also read and write. In the text is says, ""Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employees had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt \u2014 they could read and write."" This shows that they had an important skill and job. At the bottom of the structure were slaves and farmers. Slaves were forced to work on building projects. The slaves had to do hard labor. The farmers worked on the fields, raised aimals, kept canals and reservoirs in good shape, and much more. To prove that, the text states, ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments."" Farmers also paid taxes that could take away as much as 60% of their yearly-harvest.  As one can see, all people in ancient Egypt had  job, and that ancient Egypt's social structure is different from today. One can also see how different levels of social classes had different power. Egypt's system of government played a important role in ancient Egypt. ",610,1
2.2406147,2.3598104,64f540d9f37d,3b9047,"The text says that the social structure works similar to that of a pyramid.  At the top, of course, is the gods. Because, I mean, THEY'RE GODS. Underneath them is the Pharohs. This is due to the fact that people believe that the Pharohs were the human versions of the gods. The Pharohs held the most responsiblility and were the most powerful. They were also buried within stone pyramids. Beneath the Pharohs lies the Nobles, who essentially were the government. To quote from the text, they ""profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh."" Oh yeah, and the Preists (also up here with the Nobles) had the job of making sure that the gods were happy, and didn't hypothetically cause the destruction of humanity,  but THAT DOESN'T MATTER. Anyways, next is the middle class. the middle class, of course, was in the middle.  It contained craftsmen(men refering to both men and women, plus the possible addition of nonbinary peeps if the term hypothetically existed at the time) and shopkeepers. But what did they make? What did they sell? Well what do YOU think?? Ok, I might understand if you were having trouble figuring out what craftsmen did(which was make things such as jewlery,pottery, and tools by the way),  but shopkeepers??? I think you might be able to find out yourself. OK, MOVING ON, we have soldiers. Who, in most societies, you might expect to be higher than the middle class, but NOPE. THEY'RE AT THE BOTTOM. Well, not at the bottom, but.. Let's just say that in the egyptian society, you're either at the top, or at the bottom. And, despite the existence of the middle class, THERE IS NO INBETWEEN. So, yeah. Soldiers. They uh, fought in wars, of course, and they also supervised the peaseants and farmers...That's all I really know. Sorry. Alright, and now the moment in which you bois n gals n nonbinary pals have all been waiting for...the absolute bottom...the lowest of the lows...drumroll please...SLAVES AND FARMERS, YALL! Aight so slaves were essentially made out of a whole bunch of peeps who were taken captive during war, and such. They were used to work on building projects, and let's be honest, were probably treated like crap. And farmers, on the other hand, were...FARMERS! And they did, uh...Very..Farmer-y things. They..THEY WERE FARMERS. They also helped build royal monuments, and, to quote from the text, ""paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest"". So, if their yearly harvest were hypothetically around, let's say...$10,000, then they'd be left with...*calculating*...$4,000. So, when it came to taxes, farmers, too, WERE TREATED. LIKE. CRAP. (and I personally dont think that the farmers should be so low because unlike everyone else, they make the food that's KEEPING EVERYONE ELSE A L I V E. that's just how I see it thought.)",711,1
3.2976425,2.6463723,d5a135e55d4d,3b9047,"The base starts with farmers and slaves. The economical positions rise as they go up. At the very top point of the pyramid are the gods. Here is the order from greatest to least: Egyptian Gods/Pharaohs,  nobles/priests, soldiers, craftmen/traders, and lastly farmers/slaves. The gods are at the highest position in status. They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, ""They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict. All the laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh."" Because the pharaohs/gods couldn't do all the duties themselves they have assistants called viziers which are chief ministers. They have the duty of collecting taxes from people like farmers. According to the article, ""No single person could manage all these duties without assistance. The pharaoh appointed a chief minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected."" Called a ""chain of command"" the viziers have assistants as well.  They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods/pharaohs there are the nobles/priests. According to the text, the only people who can develop government posts are the nobles. And priests' duties are to keep the gods satisfied. Like said in the text, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods."" Also, the nobles grow very wealthy from recieving all the gifts of the gods from the subjects. Next are the soldiers. The soldiers fight in wars or end ""domestic uprisings."" Also, they sometimes keep an eye on farmers, peasants, and slaves. As said in the article, ""Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces."" Next comes the middle class which is made up of skilled people life artisans, craftmen/women, and physicians. The craftmen would create jewlery and other products and then sell them to make some money. They were known as the merchants and sorekeepers. ""Skilled workers such as physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus products, tools, and other useful things. Naturally, there were people needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public."" And at the bottom/base are the farmers and slaves. The farmers has to raise animals, take care of the fields, conduct some tasks in the stone quarries, construct royal monuments, and are responsible to keep the reservoirs and canals in shape. They also have to pay 60% of their annual harvest towards tax. ""Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs  in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest\u2014that\u2019s a lot of hay!""  Although people can't raise their status, young boys can go to school to learn how to read/write and then can become scribes or can apply for employment in the government which would make their status rise. The slaves have to work on developing projects and put extreme effort at the disrection of the nobles or pharaohs. ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers.

2.8268826,2.3165166,46bdbaace78f,ebad26,"With the help of Sinclar and Jonas, the shameful conditions that once occurred in Chicago's meatpacking industry had been caught. Specifically, Sinclar reveals the immoral actions that transpired in an attempt to cover up spoiled meat.  Sinclar indicates that the factories covered up spoiled meat through masking odors, reusing rejected meat, and combining normal meat and rat meat simply out of pure laziness. For example, Sinclar states that the meat ""would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" That quote in itself explains one of the many attempts in which the factories hid their corrupt techniques. Additionally, Sinclar incorporates vivid and descriptive imagery to illustrate the masked meatpacking process. Sinclar states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it. It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats."" The explanation regarding the rats and the leaky rooms emphasizes the feeble conditions located in the specific offices. Another way in which the factory workers hid their spoiled meat was by supplementing odorous pickles to the most spoiled portions of meat. This was done in an attempt to mask the stench of the meat. Overall, Sinclar uses tone and imagery to illustrate the corrupt business done by meatpacking workers. ",328,2
2.4180205,1.8437774,82cb6b907881,ebad26,"    In the excerpt from the 1906 novel,""The Jungle"" by Upton Sinclair, it states the various ways the factory would use or cover up spoiled meat. In the text it states, "" Jonas told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed..."" (Sinclair par.2).  From the text it's shown that the workers would use baking soda to take away the strong odor of the sour meat, and even used chemistry to give it a more fresh taste and odor. This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick. In paragraph 2 it also states, ""... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty percent'"" (Sinclair par.2). When the stench from the meat was bad enought workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the odors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the odors to sell spoiled meat to consumers. ",329,2
1.9563487,1.3008924,e18f9d574064,ebad26,"To start off, the factory would use or cover up meat by injecting chemicals into the ham to take away the odor and to either skin the animal or chop out the bones, especially the bad meat surrounded by a particular bone. Plus using machines made the meat more plump and juicy.  Also they would even cook up tiny bits of skin as head of cheese. California hams were the meat that took up the animal's shoulder which were real tough. The text says, ""rub soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters.  ""Boneless hams,\u201d which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed; and \u201cCalifornia hams,\u201d which were the shoulders and big knuckle joints.

The machines consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; this needle plunged  into meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds."" This demonstrates the idea of how all employees within a factory process the meat by using these different working methods. To summarize, a few ways that helped the factory to make it more efficent was by covering up the ghastly smell, using machinery to help workers, and taking out the bad meat from the inside. Of course, there are a couple of other systems like combining other meat together to make sausages. ",334,2
2.1508782,1.5622243,66e264e21721,ebad26,"The factory would often mask the smell of the spoiled meat by ""giving them thirty percent"", which used a pump that was stronger than usual to destroy the smell. They would also rub soda on the meat at times to take away the spoiled smell, Sinclar says, ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters."" Another way they would cover up spoiled meat would be taking the bone out and replacing it with a white-iron rod, as Sinclair states, ""after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad... they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"", and then they would label these as ""boneless hams"", getting rid of the three level grading scale. In order to cover up spoiled meat, the factory would also just mix it in with non spoiled meat, to make it look like they had used one-hundred percent non spoiled meat. The factory would also take in old sausage that had been rejected and use chemicals to mask the spoilage, and then reuse it, Sinclair goes more in depth when he says, ""there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white \u2013 it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.""",338,2
3.1877265,2.8101482,91368bc293b4,ebad26,"Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were unsanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or odorless products in order to mask the stench. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with unspoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieaces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906).

One way the factory did this in the beginning was by chopping it up and making it into sausage. In the text it says the meat couldn't be used for anything else so sausage was their last resort. Another way they covered up spoiled meat was by using chemicals. In the text it says ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of picle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This goes to show chemicals played a role in the process, but not only did they make it into sausage and use chemicals, they also would pump the meat. Over time the factory gained control over a second pickle one much stronger than the first and this one got rid of the odor of the meat completely making the price rise thiry cents because the meat didn't smell. Although the meat was already contaminated and spoiled enough, they even furthered and used the skin of the oldest hogs. This skin wasn't very appealing to the eye or probably the sense of touch so they would chop it up into finer pieces and call it ""head cheese"". The last process of the factory occured when the meat was completely spoiled mold and all. The text says ""it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."". This is the last way the factory covered up their spoiled meat.

""To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor\u2014a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty per cent.'""

They would also perform any ""miracle"" of chemistry, ""giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose"" (Sinclair p 2). To save time and increase their capacity, they used a machine that would be able to pickle a ham in a few seconds, but would sometimes leave the hams spoiled with a disgusting odor. To solve this issue, the packers used a stronger pickle. After smoking the hams, some would be found to have gone bad but were still sold to the public as ""Number Three Grade"". To solve this problem, they decided to extract the bone and insert a white-hot iron, getting rid of all but Number One Grade. To be able to keep selling to the general public, the packers made up numerous schemes and ""they had what they called 'boneless hams,' which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and 'California hams,' which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy 'skinned hams,' which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no  one would buy them--that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled 'head cheese!'""

(3) Sinclair explains that these factories are willing to risk the health of many human beings for some more money. Not only are the factories willing to do this but the employees aswell.  Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminate meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not. Not only was it not a simple answer there was no question.  ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it ... . It was too dark in these storage places to see well ... There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner"" (4-5) Sinclair goes on to explain that there was not an option for the workers, and the factory owners knew this.  They knew the workers needed the money to provide for their families.  To add to the atmosphere of the factories Sinclair says, ""With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge"" (1) The people were scared to step up for fear of backlash from their ""family"".

Additionally, other conditions were that, ""...there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them""(Sinclair 2). To cover this issue up, they would rub sode on the meat to try to deordorize it. Yet, that not working shows how gross the meat really was. The workers did not wash their hands- they did not even have the ability to do so, and they spit all over the food. There was absolutely no sense of sterilization as, ""...making a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage.

To cover this up, they would trick their consumers and re-color the meat with broax and gelatin to make it look a presentable color.

Sinclair starts to  explain the sausage process, ""Some of it they would make into ""smoked"" sausage \u2013 but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown. "" (Paragraph 5).  He proceeds to state that all the sausages were the same but some were labled differently to uncrease the price.  He also adds that no one pays attention to what goes in the sausage as long as its made. The meatpacking houses wrongfly hid the condition of the meat by altering the taste with stronger pickling, smell by scrubbing it with soda, color by using different chemicals that were unhealthy, and presentation by either grinding it, choping it, or whatever else was acceptable.",529,2

2.2692075,1.3077676,d72bca095079,ebad26,"In the novle ""the jungle"" by Upton Sinclair he describes how the meat packing industery worked with the meat. He went on to describe in detail the horriable unsafe, disgusting, and moraliy wrong prosses that of which the meat was packaged. One thing the industery would do is putting many chemicals into the rotten meat to make it look better so that people would buy it.  As seen in the novel, ""Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell [...] also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.

This qoute shows how the industery would use jsut about any means to sell the meat they had even if it ment using unsafe means to change it completly. Such as droping loads of rotten meat into tubs of vinager and leaving it so that it would be more appealing.  In ""The Jungle"" it also states, ""Some of it they would make into ""smoked"" sausage \u2013 but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatin to make it brown."" (Sinclair 5). This qoute shows one of the many dangerous chemicals they would put in the meat, as borax is a cleaning tool. Eatting could lead to death as seen in www.medicalnewstoday.com it states, ""Borax is not safe to ingest. According to the NLM's Toxicology Data Network, borax is easy for the body to break down when either inhaled or swallowed. However, if inhalation or ingestion occurs, both serious poisoning and organ damage can result.""(Wilson 2019). This quote shows how dangerous it is to ingest Borax.",592,2
2.7566555,1.4732946,868796a4397a,ebad26,"The first way the factory would cover up spoiled meat was to put it in sausage. In paragraph one the author writes, ""For it was the custom, as they found, whenever mear was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage."" This explains how they would put spoiled meat with fresh meat, instead of throwing the spoiled meat out. If the factory didn't put the spoiled meat in sausage, they would rub it with soda to take away the small, or they would use chemicals to enhance aspects of the meat. From paragraph two it states, ""...how the meat that was taken our of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" This explains there use of soda and chemicals to mask the spoiled meat. Next up, the factory would stuff ham with the spoiled meat using a machine and a needle. The text explains in paragraph two, ""... a cachine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds. And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled..."" This evidence further describes how they would mask spoiled meat. Finally, once the factory discovered how to take the bone out of a ham, they would insert a white-hot iron, and they would go on to sell ""boneless hams"" or ""California hams"" and fancy ""skinned hams"" which all were filled with spoiled meat. However no one would buy skinned hams, until they were cooked, and chopped up fine, which they then called ""head cheese"". Evidence comes from paragraph two, ""...but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron. The packers were always originating such schemes\u2014they had what they called \u201cboneless hams,\u201d which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and \u201cCalifornia hams,\u201d which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy \u201cskinned hams,\u201d which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them\u2014that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled \u201chead cheese!\u201d These lines of text explain the procedure that happened to the hams just for them to be sold. If Europe old sausage came back however, no matter how moldy or white it was, the factoru would dose it with borax and glycerin and then pack it with fresh meat just to sell again. ",677,2

One of these factors was the fact that all of the students obeyed every command that was given to them. Another factor is that everyone in the class were the Third Wave started would salute each other even outside of class, which would have sparked the curiosity of other students, which may cause them to join the Third Wave. Another factor that caused the development of the Third Wave is the assignment of tasks. This would lead the students to believe that they are helping the Third Movement and that they are making a change; that they were heading towards a bright future. The final factor is that the students would report anyone in the Third Wave that would fail to abide by the rules. This would cause all the members to want to work harder and follow all the rules, which would lead to the Third Wave basically governing themselves. ",177,3

The experiment was ended so quickly because with the amount of people that were a part of the movement created for an experiment, it was getting to a point where it would eventually be uncontrollable. Also, with more people becoming a part of it, the movement would qucikley become known to the rest of the  world and eventually be spread to the rest of the population.

On the first day the history teacher said to do thig like proper seating and drilled studens until they got it right. He enforced strict classroom discipline.

In paragraph 3, the text states, "" Jones instructed the students on how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day the movement had over 200 participants.""

These teens were so importnat becasue they dont have a lot that divides them, they are impressionable, and they don't have anything of their own yet, meaning that they may not be  concerned with the rights of an individual. These traits are so important because it makes it so that the teens won't question the experiment, they won't mind the lack of democracy, and they are easily united under the common goal of strength. With this rapid growth in the organisation the kids were becoming more and more brainwashed because of herd behavior, and the it needed to be ended because something bad could happen.

The experiment proved this simply with a fake group, and one person starting the wave with a few instructions grew to 200 people following those same instructions.

When the students joined the movement, not only they followed every single rule put by Jones, rules such as calling him Mr.Jones for every remark they wanted to make. They had to be sitted and oaying attention before the second bell, had to stand up every time one asked a question with three words or fewer. These were strict rules, rules that they were not used to. Yet, they followed them. Moreover, the experiment ended because Jones got a little worried that these experiment was getting a little out of control. The students were too loyal and their discipline was outstanding. They were taking this movement very seriously. ",275,3

He started this experiment in 1967, in an attempt to teach his students how groups of people throughout history have had the advantage of influencing others to follow their path, regardless of how nefarious their actions were. He wanted to show the students first hand how this movement worked. He announced that he was starting a movement to eliminate democracy, and he started to get his students involved immediately. Jones instilled extensive rules and proper disciplinary skills into his students by the end of the first day. The movement picked up steam, and by the third day, the movement expended to over 40 students. They even had a salute resembling that of the Nazi regime. Everyone obeyed Jones. However, by the fourth day, more than 200 students joined in on the bandwagon, and the experiment was getting out of control. Therefore, Jones decided to end it by tricking his students into thinking that the Third Wave was a nationwide movement and that a Presidential Candidate would officially confirm its existence. in the end, that definitely did not happen. Instead, Jones simply announced that the students were a part of an experiment and that he was trying to show them how a group of people can band together to brainwash others and create a sense of superiority.",281,3

They also ""were required to preface, begin, each remark with \u201cMr. Jones.\u201d (Paragraph 2)  Jones also had the students greet eachother in and outside of calss with a solute that was like the Nazi regime.  After 3 days the initial 30 students went up to 42 participating in the Third Wave. This was only the begining as the amount of attendees went up to 200 by the end of the school day.  That was just one part of why the expiriment was ended. ""By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control."" (Paragraph 4) Jones had to tell the students that the whole nation was a part of this and it would be proven on the television on Friday. When Friday came, they were told that it was an expiriment to prove that people can be willing to try and put themsleves above people. This was told to the students after they were watching a blank channel of the television for a few minutes. ",284,3
2.3124106,2.588268,be6dddc74b14,814d6b,"It started off with the question Ron Jones found himself asking of why did people throughout history follow the crowd even when terrible things are happening. He tried to answer this question by getting rid of democracy due to the point that he believed that democracy was the main weakness and that it favors individual over the whole community. As democracy was expelled from the classroom Ron Jones was seem to become more of an authoritarian figure in the classroom as he told the rules and continue to make a very strict resume for students to be as disciplined as possible. The main concern in this experiment was when he made a slew resembling that of the Nazi regime where students would have to salute to each other even when they were outside his classroom. As the movement gained popularity the new motivated students became a sort of court not letting any nonmembers into the classroom and eventually got over 200 participants. The main reasoning for terminating the movement was because students became too invested into the experiment and Jones felt it was slipping out of his control to get rid of the experiment he lied to the students by announcing that the third wave was a part of a national wave movement and Jones ordered students to attend a publicly announced presidential candidate of the movement, when the day came they were presented with a blank channel and Jones saw that as an opportunity to announce that they were a part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superiority over others even when horrible things are happening.",286,3

Mr. Jones started off on simple terms which, over a little bit of time, grasped the students' minds. It helped them feel like part of a group, and that is a good feeling to hold, especially to teenagers. So when Mr. Jones amped it up a bit by giving them certain privliges it kept blinding them from it even though it seemed sketchy. They didn't question and if someone did the other kids wouldn't listen and instead report them. The students were so blind that they didn't even realise they were performing something close to the Nazi soldier symbol. The kids were also not just doing it blindly. At the beginning of the experient he conditioned them to think of him as an authoritive figure and they if they didnt listen they would be disiplined. Just like the Nazis, if they didnt do what Hitler wanted them to do, well they could just die or go to jail. So that shows that some might have been forced into it. Mr. jones ended the experiment to show the kids how far they went and to teach them how easily it was to be sucked in, because they all just were. This goes to show how dangerous it can be to follow a crowd, so go out there and be independent.",288,3

Jones would have strict rules for his students to follow to see how brainwashed he could get them, this was called an Experiment. The students would be so disicplined that they would even snitch on each other and jones was  very suprised because most of his students were teens and teens tend to keep secrets and rebellious, but they were so loyal that they would tell him and try to be the best of them all. Jones was suprised but same happy on how he changed there way of attitude towards people till the point Jones himself got freaked out and knew that it was getting out of hand. The next day Jones decides to end his experiment and to tell the truth so later on the day he told the students that the presidential candidate that the Third Wave was a part of a Nationwide movement and that the next day the movement was gonna be pubicly announce its existence on television. But as the student were waiting in a room they were faced to a blank channel until Jones finally told them they were part of an experiment to demonstrate how people willingly create a sense of superirity, and this ended up making the students to quit the program and leave and live a normal life again.",293,3

The movement went from 30 participants to 44 on the first day , he taught the students how to initiate new members, and by the end of the day there were over 200 members.

2.5175943,2.5549722,a04bba18f7d2,814d6b,"The way that the Third Wave experiment developed over the five days that it was exponential; the ending number of participants made the original number pale in comparison to the original number.  The main reason that the experiment was able to grow as fast as it did in the short amount of time that it was active was because of the way that the experiment looked to those outside of it. The author says ""All of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or other tasks to bring honor to the movement,"" (CommonLit 3). It is common knowledge that envy and jealousy are present in every human being, and this must be the reason that so many outside students joined. As described in the quote, there were many things within the experiment that were exclusive of outside students. The students out of the experiment must have felt a desire to join in with the other students, an indirect form of peer pressure, if you will. The experiment was ended early due to its rapidly increasing intensity, and the operator of the experiment feared what would become of it were it to continue, thus he ended it. Jones' fear is expressed in the quote, ""By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control,"" (CommonLit 5). It is clearly expressed that Jones was fearful of the students' increasing intensity and thus decided to end it, especially through the description ""that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.",333,3
2.3184102,2.4413373,11c3509b7b43,814d6b,"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because of how seriously the students reacted to the regime of the Third Wave. After the reading explains what rules were outlined to students, the text states, ""As the week went on, Jones\u2019 class transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community.  [...] This resulted in dramatic improvements to the efficiency, or orderliness, of the class. [...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees"" (CommonLit). This cluster of text qoutes shows how legitamately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is commiting said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighboor's mom told you as a kid: ""If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?""- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe. Birds for example learn to fly, walk, eat, etc. by watching their siblings and following the mother. It is human nature to follow the pack and unfortunately it is not always a benefit to society.

They were told to salute one another outside of class and after three days students from all over the school were joining in. The students showed drastic improvments on academic skills and motivation. The students could stop non-members from entering the class and he instructed them on how to create new members. By the fourth day, the students were showing so much discipline and loyalty that Jones decided it was getting out of control. He made the students attend a rally where he announced that this was an experiment to show how people willingly follow the crowd or create a sense of superitory over others leading to horrible things. This experiment developed over such a short period of time because that is what happens when the whole crowd is telling people to support or be a certain way. This happens in real life and only takes a short amount of time since so many people are following one thing or idea and it spreads rapidly. The experiment ended because Jones realized first of all that if the experiment went on any longer it would lead to an authoritarian school and result in something much more than a experiment if it went on. He also noticed that it worked out too perfectly probably and that it was time to go ahead and end the experiment since it was a success already. Jones was also not in control of it really anymore since so many students joined and took authority over it. He knew it was time to bring his main lesson across clearly to all the students at the school instead of continuing what he was against and let it get even more out of control.",382,3

The students all ended up obeying his command as stated, causing the other kids in the school to recognize that students were saluting each other. The other students became interested and wanted to join. When they learned that the students who were seen saluting each other around the halls were seeing improvements in grades, it gave them another reason to want to join the class. The class had grown by 13 students after only three days. ""The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees."" Mr. Jones recognized this increase and then taught his students how to initiate new members, growing the numbers even more.

The movement stared out small in his classroom, by having kids pratice proper seating and abide by strict rules with him as their leader.
