If it is shown the way it is to be felt; not twisted to make it funny or less serious that people will be drawn to it more.

That would lead to the audience feeling little pity or fear. The audience would not be able to properly sympathize with this character due to most being somewhere in the middle of those extremes. Additionally, both the plot and ending to a trade must show a steep downward spiral regarding this character's life preferably due to human error.

Relating to the character can help the readers feel more understandable of the incident that the character goes through, and because the character has to be reliable to the audience, the audience will see a little part of themselves in the character, which makes them feel pity. A third element of an ideal tragedy is that a tragedy should not resemble a comedy. A tragedy has to be serious, in order for the audience to feel fear, pity, and slight sympathy towards a character.

For example, in Romeo and Juliet, Romeo isn't a villain or an amazing person, but rather a typical teenage boy more than anything else.  In addition, Aristotle believes the tragic flaw should not occur due to immoral behavior by the character, but rather by an error or a mistake. For example, Romeo's tragic flaw came through his impulsive decision to marry Juliet, which wasn't a terrible, immoral act. Lastly, the plot of a tragedy should consist of a good to bad change of fortune. In the beginning of the tragedy, the character should experience something good, but his/her's fortune should turn to something bad towards the end. Overall, the ideas of a neither good nor bad character, an underserving misfortune, and a flow of a good to bad fortune are three of Aristotle's many elements of an ideal tragedy. ",218,0

In paragraph two he says a complex plan would be more effective as it will enact emotions. ""A plot of this kind would, doubtless satisfy the moral sense, but inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" (Paragraph 2). In Paragraph three he mentions a well-constructed tragedy to be single rather than double. ""Hence they are in error who censure Euripides just because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending."" (Paragraph 3). In Paragraph four he ends the plan with a perfect tragedy saying, It has an opposite catapsphrphe for the good and bad. ""The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies."" (Paragraph 4).",220,0

The creation of pity and fear in the viewers is critical for a play because it is the ""distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" If it instead brings prosperity to adversity, the play doesn't invoke pity or fear and the result is just shock to the viewer, which is not the intention. A complex plot is also involved in an ideological tragedy. Tragedies aim to be ""single in tissue, rather than double as maintain."" The plot should also not follow a storyline that goes from bad to good, but actually good to bad.  Lastly, character is another important aspect. Character is usually one that is considered to be a person who is good, but suffers misfortune and even their downfall due to their own judgement, making them very reliable. Usually they are also famous and prosperous, as seen with Tedious and Theses. Therefore, pity and fear, complex plots, and character are all crucial to an ideological tragedy.",221,0

Meaning that the ideal tragedy should c complex and draw the audience in, and not be simple and boring/to the point.  ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" This meaning, that it should ignite something within tone audience and bring about emotions of sorrow or longing to the character or characters.

He starts out by describing actions, ""...excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle, 2). The method that the author should take, Aristotle suggests, is one where actions of the characters promote feelings of remorse and a little bit of fear for the excitement. Another element Aristotle believes is in an ideal tragedy is, ""the downfall of the utter villain be exhibited"" (Aristotle, 2). Connecting this to Hamlet, this means that if Claudius is the villain, he shouldn't die because it would cause the audience to think of it as misfortune. Finally, the third ideal trait that a true tragedy should possess is, ""some great error or frailty, in a character"" (Aristotle, 3). This ultimately means that the main character, the protagonist, shall do something utterly stupid that worsens his own life. This truly would be depressing as the audience would want to see the protagonist grow in his life which goes from bad to good instead of good to bad. ",225,0

Evoking pity and fear from an audience are staples to a basic tragedy because such strong emotions practically entice the audience into the story; the audience may be able to see themselves in the story presented. The downfall of the story's villain in a tragedy should not be included because such event would only satisfy the audience and their moral sense. Pity and fear would not come from a villain's downfall because the evil had been defeated for the sake of what is ""good"" in the story. The main character of a tragedy should be balanced because their grey morality in views has the audience wonder if theiractions were deserving of such misfortune. It invites pity for the main character due to the main character not being wholly bad, just that their errors in judgement sadly brought them to misfortune.",226,0

Second, he states in paragraph 3, ""Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses - on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Tedious, Forests, Mileage, Theses, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible."" This quote shows how the best tragedies focus on characters who were greatly affected by the tragedy, which makes it have a great plot. Lastly, in paragraph 3 he also states ""The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition,"" which shows how diction and performance on the stage brings it to life and really makes it a great tragedy.

When a tradegey exits pity and fear, it usually starts with a change of fortune. In the text it says, ""... that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" This part merely shocks the audience. Finally, a tragic hero is a man that is not bad but not perfect. There is always an error of judgement or flaw. In the text it says, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families.""

""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"".  A complex plan of a plot is extremely important in order to have an ideal tragedy.  The plot must move from the beginning to the end according to a cramped sequence of events that are to happen.  Furthermore, another element to an ideal plot is character.  ""Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Tedious, Forests, Mileage, Theses, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible"".  A plot should consist of a charter going from joy to misery as the plot progresses.  A final element in order to form a perfect traded is thought.

This means that the story follows the actions and resolution of the main character only, and focuses on the character's change of fortune groom good to bad. Another element most crucial to a tragedy is that the plot must incite both fear and pity for all who watch the play. If the play ends with a ""feel good"" moment, then it has failed as a tragedy, as it doesn't incite fear and pity. The purpose of tragedy is not to  satisfy some moral sense, but to inspire feelings appropriate to witnessing a tragedy, to experience a ""cleansing"" of watching someone else suffer.  Lastly, an ideal tragedy must have a protagonist that is not overly righteous or holy, but is not deprived; the character is somewhat middle of the road.  By having the character behave in this way it makes the story more realistic and true, making the character's journey that much more engaging for the audience.

Aristotle also believes that another element of the ideal tragedy does not feature a turn from bad to good, but instead should feature the reverse and should go from good to bad. He believes that this turn should be brought about by a crucial mistake made by a character. The third element of an ideal tragedy is one with a single issue as its plot. Aristotle compares those with a ""double threat of plot"", like the Odyssey, as second rank. He believes that it is only considered the best because of the weakness of the audience.

Aristotle overall scopes the plot of perfect tragedy by revealing that the  character must be one of prestige.

In doing this, Aristotle indicates that one of the key features of an ideal tragedy involves an individual that is highly prosperous in order to drive his plot even further. The second element expressed is the trait within a character that allows for a downfall. Aristotle also used Tedious, Forests, and other tragic heroes from mythology in order to heavily emphasize that the flaw in the personality. Aristotle mentions that this error in one's character should be due to misjudgment or frailty. Evidently, all these elements influence the overall idea he expressed that to a perfect tragedy an individual must experience a downfall or a reversal of misfortune.

The plot of an ideal tragedy is a man that is neither good nor evil whose life falls apart because of a mistake. The tragedy must pass feelings of terror and commotion to the public, it should be highly emotional and precise. A tragedy also must have intimate language and actions that engage the readers and excite pity and fear. The language and actions bring different alliances and excitement throughout. The language should be pleasant and easily understood by the audience. A tragedy must have true tragic endings and not resemble comedies. An example of a comedy, not a tragedy is when those who are enemies leave the stage as friends at the end, and no one kills or is killed. It is overuse and cliché. A tragedy must have death, successes, losses, and different feelings so people can become engaged and feel the emotions.

This desire for readers to feel pitiful and fearful leads to Aristotle's second element of an ideal tragedy; for it to be emotional. Aristotle claims that an emotional piece ""is proper rather to Comedy,"" suggesting that all tragedies should end with the reader feeling sorrow. (Aristotle 4).

The first main element for a tragedy to be ideal is for it to follow a complex plan and/or plot. The twists and turns of the storyline should not be easily predicted by the readers. Furthermore, the narrative the writer is trying to tell his audience should always end in leaving the readers and the character(s) unhappy. In relation to this element, the second main ingredient to create an ideal tragedy is to incite emotion from the readers, more specifically, pity and fear. Aristotle believes that the readers should not only see the pity and fear that the character is going through, but they should also feel it in an intense manner. Lastly, the third main element to creating an ideal tragedy according to Aristotle is to have a reliable and good character make a reasonable mistake. What Aristotle means from this is to have a character of goodness be brought down by a mistake that anyone could have made but is created to be blown out of proportion. An ""error of judgment or frailty,"" to be exact. This element is important because it creates further pity and fear for the readers to feel towards the character.

If the story isn't complex then the story wouldn'te entertaining and enthralling to the reader. The story need to be long enough for the audience to understand the long suffering that the protagonist  goes through. The second element of a good tragedy would the progress from good to bad fortune throughout the story.  A tragedy isn't a tragedy if the protagonist has a happy ending because it just isn't tragic. In order for the story to be tragic there needs to be a great amount of misery and woe involving the protagonist having the good things in life take from them throughout the span of the story. The third element of a good tragedy is an unhappy ending. If the story ends happily for the protagonist then the story is not at all sad or tragic. We as people prefer to have a story end happily for the protagonist because it sits with us better.

Another element that is described by Aristotle is that main character must have a change of fortune.

The character that is not successful, or  ""good and just"" will also be the charter who isn't a bad person but is judged because of some ""error"" or past situation that is now defined as his reputation. Instances like that in movies are predictable which doesn't make them tragedies anymore. The last ideal tragedy is spectacle. The spectacle part of tragedy refers to how things are seen. Such as characters, the set up of the movie or play, how they dress and sound and other things along that line. Spectacle can occur in tragedy because everything isn't as it seems. The way the characters dress act and sound could cover up their true identify. With that being said the people wouldn't expect the nice sweet guy to be the mass murderer of the play.

Aristotle also writes ""...a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about...by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned..."" This proves that Aristotle believes that the main character of a great tragedy must be a man who is neither good nor evil, but somewhere in between; and that that man must be prosperous or renowned. Finally, Aristotle states ""...pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves."" Therefore, if a tragedy were to display a man such as one described above, and have a random, unforeseen misfortune fall him, the audiences would easily be able to relate.

Aristotle also goes on to say that the protagonist in a tragedy should not be someone who is perfect and saint-like, but it also should not be someone who is evil. He says, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes-that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is borough about not by vice,"" (Paragraph 2).  The final element that, according to Aristotle, makes an ideal tragedy is the change of fortune. He says, ""the change of fortune should not be from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Paragraph 3).

It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation.""  Due to this, Aristotle indicates how tragedies should be deeply thought out to provide an emotional experience in a reader.  Furthermore, a second aspect is how the changes throughout the plot will lead to a downfall of a character or event.  He demonstrates that the change should be ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad.""  Moreover, a third aspect of a tragedy is that the plot and storyline should follow one strict and sole storyline that will lead to the eventual negative outcome.  Aristotle suggests, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""

Aristotle  believes that the goal of a tragedy is to ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" and argues that in order for the tragedy to accomplish this goal, it should feature the downfall of a hero ""who is neuter eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought on not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""

He establishes this in the third paragraph: ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.

Aristotle explains that the feeling of pity and fear is ""the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (2). In order for one to incite those feelings from an audience, someone who is neither fully good, nor bad, has to fall a misfortune. This misfortune has to come from a good place and change circumstances for the worse. ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty..."" (Aristotle 3). This means that in order to have a good trade, one must have a main character make a costly mistake that causes them great hardship. The last element of a good tragedy is the avoidance of the utter downfall of a villain, because, according to Aristotle, ""...it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (2). And as stated earlier, pity and fear are one of the most necessary components to an ideal tragedy, so if villain dies a horrible death, the story won't have the necessary components.

As stated in paragraph 2, Aristotle remarks that "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" Aristotle is explaining how the best method of displaying tragedy in any poem is to put the main characters in a constant state of misfortune, which is meant to drive forward the narrative as it progresses. Next, Aristotle exclaim that the main character in a tragedy should never been considered ""good or bad"", but in between the two extremes. He claims in paragraph 2, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity,  but by some error of judgement or frailty"". He emphasizes that the best way to craft a main character in a tragedy is not to witness a good man suffer from misfortune or a bad man pay for his crimes, but a simple man suffer for making mistakes that may be reliable to the reader themselves. Finally, Aristotle suggests that good tragedies must always involve particular families who have evil past. He explains this in paragraph 3 when he states, "" Now, the best tragedies are founded on the story of a few houses — on the fortunes of Alcmaeon, Tedious, Forests, Mileage, Theses, Telephus, and those others who have done or suffered something terrible.""

According to the text, Aristotle states that ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (para 2).

The second element of a tragedy, as mentioned, there should be a reversal in fate going from good to bad and not from bad to good. An additional detail should include the idea that the misfortune causing a person to go from ""prosperity to adversity"" (para 2) should be ""unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves"" (para 2). This means that the misfortune should be in a manner that the person suffering the misfortune does not necessarily deserve it. Only then is it thought that pity or fear will be evoked to be considered as an ideal or effective tragedy. The third element of an ideal tragedy is the misfortune coming about due to ""some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse"" (para 3).

1.2870063,0.6842348,57d4aad66e97,39c16e,"    The ideal tragedy should include a multi-dimensional conflict, a neutral character's mistake, and that character's fortune turning from good to bad. A conflict that only has one tragic trait is not a tragedy, since it will not have enough dimension to provoke the emotions within an audience that are associated with tragedy, since this kind of conflict ""never satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear"" due to its basic nature (""On Tragedy""). Therefore, the writer(s)  should include multiple traits that build up to form the many different pillars that make a tragedy, since tragedies rarely occur because of a single tragic trait. To follow this conflict outline, the main character in a tragedy should be neither good nor bad, and their misfortune should occur due to a mistake that they've made. This is because ""pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves,"" meaning that it will be easier for the audience to feel pity and sympathize with a character if they can see themselves in that character's shoes (""On Tragedy""). The character's fortune should also change from good to bad, since this will reflect the same pity in the audience that was aforementioned. When it comes down to why the target feeling is pity, that's because pity is the leading feeling that audiences have when reacting to tragedies. After all, tragedies are defined as ""great suffering, destruction, and distress,"" and these types of situations always have emotional consequences (Oxford Dictionary). If a tragedy is unsuccessful in provoking the emotions that come with tragedy, then it clearly would not be the ideal tragedy. ",335,0

The second element of a tragedy is that the plot should contain a man neither good nor evil whose life falls apart from a mistake. A character should not move from pure happiness to pure misfortune, or vise versa.

This helps to explain why he stresses how the story should change, ""not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad"" (3). Tragedies are supposed to be sad and make the reader feel bad for the character which a story from good to bad does, while a story from bad to good  expresses the feeling of achievement and shapes for the better. Lastly he describes the element of how misfortune is not brought by, ""Vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty""(2). He said the character can't be a villain because this wouldn't be a tragedy and the person couldn't be someone known for being good. It must be a renowned and prosperous person whose misfortune happens because he makes a wrong judgment or bad choice instead of something they have always done like a habit.

Primarily, Aristotle discusses about the importance of constructing a plot that goes from good to bad. Having a good to bad plot will lead to an ""end unhappily. It is... the right ending."" If this plot is able to work, the most tragic effect will be the outcome because it satisfies ""the moral sense, [and' inspires pity or fear."" Moreover, an ideal tragedy needs to build emotions from readers. The perfect tragedy must ""imitate actions which excite pity and fear"" which is achieved by a change of fortune from good to bad. Aristotle makes it clear that emotions are able to occur when ""some great error or frailty"" happens that changes the character from descriptions mentioned before which makes a character go from good to bad. Lastly, a tragedy should be built on a complex plan. For a complex plan, the audience should feel pity for a character which would later be used against the audience. Trying to reverse the effects of making the audience feel pity to fear is key for a perfect tragedy as ""it is accounted the best because of the weakness of the spectators."" Poets need to take audiences by surprise because it's similar to killing off the main character of a movie, for it would bring in tons of emotion and catch the audience off guard of something they would never expect to happen. All in all, Aristotle tries to convey his point of how to create a perfect tragedy and demonstrates how thoughtful and impactful a tragedy could be. However, Aristotle wants to make it more known that a short story can be constructed in an emotionally compelling way part of which still applies even in modern times.",361,0
1.4540797,0.7240406,eb76bd210a89,39c16e,"One element of an ideal tragedy, as summarized by Aristotle, is that there should be a serious change in circumstances of the main character, specifically a change from good circumstances to bad, instead of bad to good. Aristotle says ""The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad."" Aristotle argues that if the fortune changed from bad to good, then it wouldn't invoke any feelings of pity in us, as it wouldn't be considered a tragedy if a character's fortune increased throughout the play, as this would be a good thing. Aristotle also says a good tragedy should portray a character who is somewhere in the middle between being inherently good and inherently bad. He says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes - that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""

Lastly, Aristotle says a good tragedy should exhibit a character experiencing misfortune due to a flaw in his character, not necessarily because of bad or immoral behavior. He says ""It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse.""

First, the element of the plot for an ideal strategy is meant to be the soul of the overall tragedy as a whole, and its main responsibility to keep every other factor that is part of a tragedy together. Aristotle believes that the plot should always be provided a beginning, middle, and end, in a proper way.  ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain.""(Paragraph. 3) Overall, Aristotle's belief of the concept regarding plot is to be an imitation of an action, a single action. Second, the element of the character for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered as neither good nor bad, as a result, should instead be considered as a surprise to the audience of the character's morals. ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes.""(Paragraph 2) Aristotle thinks that if the tragic hero were to be better than one to be good or bad, then the tragedy as a whole would be seen as stronger than before. Third, the element of the thought for an ideal tragedy is meant to be considered always on the type of situation being given, whether it is an individual who lives in prosperity or an individual who lives in adversity. ""yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty.""(Paragraph 2) In terms of thought, the thoughts that should be considered is if the kind of unexpected sort of events happens should they belong to the wealthy or the poor, because of someone's poor sense of judgement or by fate.

1.6832373,0.8518096,888abfac4dc6,39c16e,"As described by Aristotle, one element of an ideal tragedy is one that effectively voices it plot through a single lens from which is complex and venturing out into different perspectives instead of and rather than being clear and concise and simplistic to a certain degree. This is supported within the passage in paragraph 2 where it states, ""A perfect tragedy should...be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan."" This quote by Aristotle is comprehending the purpose of the passage to build up the ideal tragedy, and to make the experience for the audience more interesting and worth-while to bring about analogies and comparison on the greatness of tragedies, in general. Another element of an ideal tragedy, according to Aristotle, is the use of pity and fear through imitation of certain actions from which  is a persuasive technique used to bring in the audience for more and feel compassion for the main character being affected at hand. Evidence from the text to support this statement is near the beginning of paragraph 2 where it states, ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" From this expression by Aristotle, we can sense the urgency of pity and fear to the makeup of a tragedy and from which, in line, feeds into the different objectives of a tragedy and what makes a tragedy ideal to Greek playwrights. Last, but not least, the third element of an ideal tragedy mentioned is to have a tragedy that is of a single reference and reasoning from which is the result of misassumed and misfortune actions rather than of actual bad influence and illicit actions, as seen within paragraph 3 where it states, ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double...[i]t should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty.""",372,0

Firstly,  Aristotle believed that a plot should be complicated rather than simple. The text states ""A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan"" (Aristotle). This quote shows how he believes a complicated plot is a necessity for tragedy. Aristotle  also believed that a tragedy should cause pity and fear in the audience. in paragraph 2, the text states, "" It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation"" (Aristotle). This once again brings up the topic of catharsis otherwise known as emotional release. Aristotle believes that a true tragedy should make the audience feel pity and frightened and be able to release these emotions because of the show. Aristotle also believed that the characters should be reliable to invoke this fear into the people. The text states, ""that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity"" (Aristotle). This explains how a charter that is morally grey, as most humans are, will be more reliable and make the audience feel pity. They will also be scared, because they do not want this to happen to themselves. Lastly,  Aristotle believes that these plays should end tragically or else it is second tiered.  The article states "" The pleasure, however, thence derived is not the true tragic pleasure. It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Forests and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain"" (Aristotle). In this he is explaining that without the unhappy ending, it doesnt not give the audience 'true tragic pleasure'. This is what Aristotle characterized Greek tragedies by during his time as a philosopher.",397,0
1.5387982,0.73780054,8a72454de3e0,39c16e,"At least 3 elements of an ideal tragedy, as described by Aristotle are having characters that the audience can relate to, a well constructed plot brought about by an error, and they follow a true tragic ending. When discussing a tragic character, Aristotle states that it is important to have a character that the audience can relate to. He does this when he says ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families."" He states that it is important to have a character with these traits because it aroused fear and pity in the audience. He states this throughout paragraph two when he says ""It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation."" In paragraph three, Aristotle begins to discuss the importance of plot. Aristotle states that the plot of a play should not be simple but not overly complex. He states this when he says ""A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain."" He then goes on to say that throughout the plot, the change of fortune should go from good to bad. In the last paragraph, Aristotle discusses true tragic endings and how some well know plays are mistaken for tragedies. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy has a complex plot. He states this in the quote ""In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. "" He then moves on to say that these types of tragedies do not have true tragic ends. Aristotle states that a second rank tragedy ""is proper rather to Comedy"" and ends with ""those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies....quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This takes away from a true tragedy because in the end, the protagonist must face their downfall. ",430,0
1.4539976,0.45368057,66db2c282419,39c16e," Three elements of an ideal tragedy that are described by Aristotle are plot, character, and diction. Plot should give a single issue and not double and should be from good to bad in terms of change of fortune. The fortune should come as a result of error in a character from better to worse and imitate pity and fear. Character should be defiant of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity from the spirit of Tragedy and possess no tragic qualities and related to the audience to create emotions. Fiction or choice of words should be arranged in a simple, but complex plan and imitate actions of pity and fear, while also thoroughly satisfying moral sense and well-being. Evidence to support these statements are in paragraphs 2 and 3 where it reads, "" A plot of this kind would, doubtless, satisfy the moral sense, but it would inspire neither pity nor fear; for pity is aroused by unmerited misfortune, fear by the misfortune of a man like ourselves...A well-constructed plot should, therefore, be single in its issue, rather than double as some maintain. The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad. It should come about as the result not of vice, but of some great error or frailty, in a character either such as we have described, or better rather than worse... the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty...A perfect tragedy should, as we have seen, be arranged not on the simple but on the complex plan. It should, moreover, imitate actions which excite pity and fear, this being the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. It follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity."" These pieces of evidence further support my assertion of the three main elements of an ideal tragedy being plot, character, and diction by showing the importance of a plot and its significance of portraying pity and fear and character and its importance of showing one's personality to be from adversity to prosperity, while showing the significance of diction and its well-being of providing a sense of pity and fear and satisfying moral sense throughout the play and tragedy in its choice of words.",482,0
1.5648502,0.8765963,8d9cd2ec20cb,39c16e,"Three elements of an ideal tragedy as described by Aristotle are a well constructed plot, a character's soul, as well as the production/performance. The most important element of an ideal tragedy is based off of the plot. Aristotle says that, "" The change of fortune should be not from bad to good, but, reversely, from good to bad,"" (Aristotle, 3). The outcome of the main character will have come from some sort of great error or frailty, the ideal tragic hero should be an all good man with a very minor flaw in his character, and the entire tragedy should be continued upon this judgement. Aristotle also explains how a the plot should be a very complex plan where the actions of the characters exemplify emotions such as pity and fear with the distinctive mark of tragic imitation. He suggests that the best sorts of a tragedy are the complex plots that arose both pity and fear. He then explains how a good plot must avoid a hero becoming miserable, avoid the transition from misery to happiness for an the antagonist, and also avoid the antagonist to feel happiness and leading into one's misery. He simply just believes that the best plot derives from the misfortune of someone and whose future downfall leads to an error in judgement. The second element includes the character's actions and personality. To Aristotle, the character must be set up for failure even though this character has the personality of a ""good character."" The show , ""follows plainly, in the first place, that the change of fortune presented must not be the spectacle of a virtuous man brought from prosperity to adversity: for this moves neither pity nor fear; it merely shocks us. Nor, again, that of a bad man passing from adversity to prosperity: for nothing can be more alien to the spirit of Tragedy; it possesses no single tragic quality; it neither satisfies the moral sense nor calls forth pity or fear,"" (Aristotle, 2).  Meaning this, the overall sense and focus of the play should not be based on the hero losing his ""good."" Instead, the character must make multiple judgements and go through an entire storyline, not aware of the downfall set right for him. The final element of an ideal tragedy is the spectacle and production itself. Although Aristotle does not go fully into the details regarding this element, in paragraph 3, it is noted that "" A tragedy, then, to be perfect according to the rules of art, should be of this construction....because he follows this principle in his plays, many of which end unhappily. It is, as we have said, the right ending. The best proof is that on the stage and in dramatic competition, such plays, if well worked out, are the most tragic in effect"" (Aristotle, 3). Rather than explaining the scenic visuals of the play and visual effects of a ""spectacle,"" Aristotle explains that the true spectacle is the dramatic competition and the tragedy in effect. The best endings is one that is unhappy and shocks the audience. ",612,0
1.433619,0.9166455,574369ff8f20,39c16e,"An ideal tragedy must have a replaceable hero, a singular plot, and a plot where the hero's own human flaws cause their demise. This is exemplified by Aristotle's description of the ideal tragic hero. Paragraph 2 states, ""There remains, then, the character between these two extremes — that of a man who is not eminently good and just, yet whose misfortune is brought about not by vice or depravity, but by some error of judgement or frailty. He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families."" It's imperative to understand that the protagonist of a Greek tragedy and their qualities are some of the defining traits of a tragedy. The protagonist has to speak to a common humanity within the audience in order to have maximum emotional appeal and impact.  The audience will only be distressed at the events the hero is subject to if they can cry with him and relate  to them just like any person. If the protagonist is either someone incredibly saint-like that never makes mistakes that result in conflict or outrageous and medically evil that succeeds because of their malevolent, the audience will not be able to see themselves in the hero because such drastic personalities or situations rarely happen in real life. Because the fundamental plot elements seem fantastical, the audience will feel more removed from the play and will not feel the pain as the hero feels it when they fail, or the triumphant when they succeed. The best way to make a hero human to the audience is to give them nuance. Like most people, the tragic hero should generally strive to do good but get caught up by their own mistakes like pride, anger, lack of judgement, etc. so that they aren't bad people but still accountable for their mistakes. It's essential to make tragic heroes essentially common men that the audience already identifies with (such as honorable nobility who are still humans without any special or divine powers) who have replaceable motivations and qualities that cause them to fail due to their own actions while still being sympathetic people. Since this reminds the audience of themselves, it will feel all the more tragic when they suffer, which is the point of the tragic play. In order to have the optimal amount of misery, the plot should be singular. This is discussed in paragraphs 3 and 4, which state, ""He must be one who is highly renowned and prosperous — a personage like Tedious, Theses, or other illustrious men of such families. ...In the second rank comes the kind of tragedy which some place first. Like the Odyssey, it has a double thread of plot, and also an opposite catastrophe for the good and for the bad. ...It is proper rather to Comedy, where those who, in the piece, are the deadliest enemies — like Forests and Aegisthus — quit the stage as friends at the close, and no one slays or is slain."" This text demonstrates how one single serious plot is necessary for a proper tragic play. A true tragedy must have the complex protagonist endure general failure as well as the associated physical and emotional pain due to their own incorrect actions, and this should be the only plot point in the play to prevent distractions. On the other hand, double plots  often resolve positively without events like major character death or conflict. The idea that the protagonist does not have to endure any of the consequences of their actions and suffer as a result is the complete antithesis of a tragedy. As a result, the audience does not reach catharsis because there are no emotional stakes if everything is fixed by the end. Therefore, they have no lasting negative emotions pertaining to the play.",733,0

Craftsmen also had to make goods for anybody in Ancient Egypt, and thats a lot to keep up with. But for soldiers they always had to protect Ancient Egypt and the pharaohs most of all. Now all the way at the bottom we have slaves, and the farmers. For them it sway harder to live life then any other person. They would always have high taxes, make sure they did everything for the pharaohs, and also they were against their will for anything. All of these structures how they worked as a government together was very surprising also because they had a great civilization for many years. Text to prove this is that in the article it states ""Egyptian society was trusted like a pyramid"". ""At the top were the gods, such as Ra, Siris, and Isis"". This showed how the structure of their government and society was like a pyramid because there were types of people in every group that made them different. For that reason the pharaohs were always on top of the list because they were more important then any other group then. It also states in the text that ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers"". ""Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war"". ""In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toiled at the discretion of the pharaoh or nobles."" This shows that after all of those nobles and pharaohs there are actually people all the way at the bottom. That have more of a tough time than others and they cannot really choose what they want to do with their life. They cannot ranked equally like the pharaohs or the nobles, because they always worked for these people. This is the structure of the ancient Egyptian government.",460,1
0.40458608,0.32488477,9e5f7a7f8af1,3b9047,"    The social structure of classes in Ancient Egypt, weren't very different from todays social structure. The pyramid of social structure was made up of three parts: The Upper class, the Middle class, and the Lower class. The Upper class was filled up by pharaohs, the Middle class was filled up by priests, nobles, craftsmen, scribes, and merchants, and the Lower class was filled by slaves, and farmers. Now, all of these places were connected to the government. Their government was basically worshipping gods and goddesses. The pharaoh was connected to the government, because he of she was the ruler of Egypt, ""Their leaders, called pharaohs, were believed to be gods in human form"" (paragraph, 2). The pharaohs were thought of as gods and goddesses, they were thought of as walking gods. The Middle class was connected to the government because they either helped the pharaoh directly, or they had sustainable jobs to sell things to people, ""Right below the pharaoh in status were powerful nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts; in these positions they profited from tribute paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods... Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings. During long periods of peace, soldiers also supervised the peasants, farmers, and slaves who were involved in building such structures as pyramids and palaces"" (paragraph, 6 and 8). The nobles and soldiers held the Middle class, because they weren't as wealthy as the pharaohs, but they had more money than the peasants, farmers, and slaves. The Lower class was connected to the government, because their jobs paid for their homes and food, ""At the bottom of the social structure were slaves and farmers. Slavery became the fate of those captured as prisoners of war. In addition to being forced to work on building projects, slaves toile at the discretion of the pharaohs or nobles. Farmers tended the fields, raised animals, kept canals and reservoirs in good order, worked in the stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest- that's a lot of hay!"" (paragraph, 11 and 12).

To start off, at the top were the gods, like Ra, Siris, and Isis stated on paragraph 1. Pharaoh's were the next and egyptian believed Pharaoh's were gods but in human forms and they had absolute power over their subjects which is stated on paragraph 2. The pharaoh directed an army  in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict stated on paragraph 3. All laws were enacted at the discretion of the pharaoh. Each farmer paid taxes in the form of grains, which were stored in the pharaoh's warehouses. This grain was used to feed the people in the event of a famine stated on paragraph 3.  The pharaoh appointed a chef minister called a vizier as a supervisor. The vizier ensured that taxes were collected stated on paragraph 4. Working with the vizier were scribes who kept government records. These high-level employers had mastered a rare skill in ancient Egypt, they could read and write stated on paragraph 5. Below pharaoh's were nobles and priests. Only nobles could hold government posts, which in these positions they profited from tributes, paid to the pharaoh. Priests were responsible for pleasing the gods stated on paragraph 6. Soldiers fought in wars or quelled domestic uprisings.

Skilled workers like physicians and craftsmen/women made up the middle class. Craftsmen made and sold jewelry, pottery, papyrus, products, tools, and other useful things stated on paragraph 9.  There were people that needed to buy goods from artisans and traders. These were the merchants and storekeepers who sold these goods to the public stated on paragraph 10.

Farmers tended the fields. raised animals, kept canals, and reservoirs in good order, worked in stone quarries, and built the royal monuments. Farmers paid taxes that could do as much as 60% of their yearly harvest stated on paragraph 12. Social mobility was not impossible. A small number of peasants and farmers moved up the economic ladder. Families saved money to send their sons to village schools to learn trades.  These schools were run by priests or by artisans. Boys who learned to read and write could become scribes, then go on a gain employment in the government stated on paragraph 13.  That is how the system of Ancient Egypt worked. ",533,1

The quote from the text shows that the gods were in charge. Next, on the system of government was the pharaohs. The pharaohs had lots of power.

Underneath them is the Pharos. This is due to the fact that people believe that the Pharos were the human versions of the gods. The Pharos held the most responsibility and were the most powerful. They were also buried within stone pyramids. Beneath the Pharos lies the Nobles, who essentially were the government. To quote from the text, they ""profited from tributes paid to the pharaoh."" Oh yeah, and the Priests (also up here with the Nobles) had the job of making sure that the gods were happy, and didn't hypothetical cause the destruction of humanity,  but THAT DOES'T MATTER. Anyway, next is the middle class. the middle class, of course, was in the middle.  It contained craftsmen(men refering to both men and women, plus the possible addition of nonbinary keeps if the term hypothetical existed at the time) and shopkeeper. But what did they make? What did they sell? Well what do YOU think?? Ok, I might understand if you were having trouble figuring out what craftsmen did(which was make things such as jewelry,pottery, and tools by the way),  but shopkeeper??? I think you might be able to find out yourself. O, MOVING N, we have soldiers. Who, in most societies, you might expect to be higher than the middle class, but NE. THEY'E T THE BOTTOM. Well, not at the bottom, but.. Let's just say that in the egyptian society, you're either at the top, or at the bottom. And, despite the existence of the middle class, HERE Id Ns INBETWEEN. So, yeah.

Alright, and now the moment in which you bois n goals n nonbinary pals have all been waiting for...the absolute bottom...the lowest of the lows...drumroll please...SLAVES AND FARMERS, ALL! Light so slaves were essentially made out of a whole bunch of keeps who were taken captive during war, and such. They were used to work on building projects, and let's be honest, were probably treated like crap. And farmers, on the other hand, were...FARMERS! And they did, uh...Very..Farmer-y things. They..THEY EE FARMERS. They also helped build royal monuments, and, to quote from the text, ""paid taxes that could amount to as much as 60% of their yearly harvest"". So, if their yearly harvest were hypothetical around, let's say...$10,000, then they'd be left with...*calculating*...$4,000. So, when it came to taxes, farmers, too, EE TREATED. IE. CAP.

They have the right to overpower everyone. Also, since everyone praises them they believe that the gods were responsible of many things as well. Like safety. Sometimes the pharaohs direct the army or create laws. As stated in the text, ""They had absolute power over their subjects...The pharaoh directed the army in case of a foreign threat or an internal conflict.

They are called scribes; they are the only ones who can read and write. Now under the whole chain of gods/pharaohs there are the nobles/priests.

One of the ways the factory covered up the meat was by injecting chemicals that would change the smell, taste, and look of it.

Baking soda would be used on the meat to eliminate the terrible odor of the spoiled meat. The factory would also inject a pickle which would eliminate the smell of the hams as well. The author states, ""To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor- a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty-percent' "" (Sinclair 3). A needle filled with stronger pickle, compared to the pickle they used on freshman, would be injected to the ham. The text states, ""Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute-flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference."" Spoiler ham would also be mixed in with  fresh meat in order to trick the public into thinking they wore only purchasing fresh meat.",311,2

1.6590298,1.8164603,91368bc293b4,ebad26,"Upton Sinclair strengthens his argument that conditions were sanitary in meat processing factories through describing the various ways in which workers would use or cover up spoiled meat. This included suppressing the odor through the use of borax and glycerin, adding more meat to cover the spoiled meat, filling hams with pickle, chopping spoiled meat to make ""sausage"", selling bad hams as ""Number Three Grade"", and through extracting the bone of bad ham and selling it as boneless ham. Since spoiled meat had a very strong odor to it, workers within factories had to ensure that consumers would not be able to smell it so that they would be more likely to buy and consume it. As a result, they used sweet smelling or colorless products in order to mask the speech. Hams were pickled with a machine that was both quick and effective, but would sometimes spoil the meat further. This detail further helped to support Sinclair's claim that factories mainly cared about making a profit rather than the health of their consumers. Additionally, factory workers used methods of hiding or covering up spoiled meat by making it more subtle through covering it with spoiled meat or chopping it into smaller pieces so it would go unnoticed by consumers. Lastly, Sinclair describes how spoiled ham was especially covered up through selling bad ham as ""Number Three Grade"" or ""smoked ham"". Later however, ""they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"" (Sinclair 1906). This would eliminate the title of ""Number Three Grade"" in favor of ""boneless ham"".",321,2

(Sinclair par.2).  From the text it's shown that the workers would use baking soda to take away the strong odor of the sour meat, and even used chemistry to give it a more fresh taste and odor. This method saved the company money, but was wrong because it was selling people spoiled meat that could possibly make them sick. In paragraph 2 it also states, ""... some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them. To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle with destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as 'giving them thirty percent'"" (Sinclair par.2). When the speech from the meat was bad enough workers would also use a machine to fill the meat with pickle to help rid of the doors. They would use much stronger pickle, and still end up selling the spoiled meat. In the end, the ways they would cover up the spoiled meat is by using baking soda, pickle, or chemistry to help rid of the doors to sell spoiled meat to consumers. ",323,2

Another way they would cover up spoiled meat would be taking the bone out and replacing it with a white-iron rod, as Sinclair states, ""after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad... they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron"", and then they would label these as ""boneless hams"", getting rid of the three level grading scale. In order to cover up spoiled meat, the factory would also just mix it in with non spoiled meat, to make it look like they had used one-hundred percent non spoiled meat. The factory would also take in old sausage that had been rejected and use chemicals to mask the spoilage, and then reuse it, Sinclair goes more in depth when he says, ""there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.""",324,2

Looking at this question of whether or not to use supplies to contaminated meat seems like a very simple answer. However, to the factory workers in the twentieth century, it was not.

One of the various ways the factory would cover up spoiled meat was by rubbing the meat against soda to get rid of the odor. According to lines 19-21, ""also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose."" They used the chemistry in the method of rubbing the meat against the soda to change the appearance and smell of the meat to make it more appetizing however, it hides the true condition of the meat.  Another way the factory covered up the spoiled meat was incorporating glycerin and borax from sausage rejected from Europe-suggesting the conditions of the spoiled meat were noticeable. According to paragraph 3 ""it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption."" Signifying this was a repeated process to get the sausage accepted to other countries.  Furthermore, the factory would hide the spoiled meat by ""giving them thirty-percent"" which was done prior to finding hams spoiled from injection.  The text states ""Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad.

This conveys that the factory narrowed down the techniques used to hinder the spoiled condition of the meat first done by intensifying the amount of pickle to hide the smell to creating devices and apparatus that extracted the ""bad parts"" (which created the condition) of the meat, in this case the bone.

1.6172752,1.7807152,9684321147d5,ebad26,"In the article, Excerpt From The Jungle, there were many ways factories tried to cover up spoiled meat. Throughout this article it tells us that no matter the color, flavor, or smell they would still sell the meat. These factories didn't care for the health of their consumers and only wanted to make money, so they sold every piece of meat that they could. While reading this article it sounds like they would never let a single piece of meat go to waste even if it was spoiled and covered in mold. In the article it states, “old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white – it would be dosed with borax and glycerin, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.”(3). This quote from the article explains to us how they covered up the molded meat by using strong and toxic chemicals to get rid of the smell and turn the meat back to brown. The factories had no health regulations, the meat was stored in places infested with germs. The factories knew how filthy their facility was and had put no effort in  to change it. In paragraph 4 it states, “There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.”(4). This tells us how nobody cared about the condition the meat was in and how no one enforced them to follow any guidelines that had been put in place. Workers knew that what they were doing was wrong and never second guessed it, “a man could run his hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats. These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.”(4). This quote from the article tells the reader how they used rat meat for sausages. These rats contained many diseases and carried poison from eating contaminated  bread. Which they thought was right to feed  humans. In the factories, spoiled meat was covered up badly. Instead of throwing away the rotting meat they found ways to use it to seem constable to humanity while they were making it much worse.",457,2
1.7517563,1.4817154,8c39908257e3,ebad26,"There were various ways that factories would use or cover up spoiled meat. The employees played a huge role in why meat was processed under harsh conditions. Workers lacked washing their hands, and the water that men washed their hands in was also ladled into sausages. Meat would be tumbled out on the floor in dust and dirt. Meat would fall onto surfaces where employees have spit thousand of times. As a result of this, meats were extremely treacherous. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs."" The meat was also in a space where rats were present, causing rats to run across the meats. As a result of rats running around, they poison them. After poisoning the rats, the rats would go in the hopper with the meat while they are processing. Workers call the poisoned rat a tidbit, and they did not care to remove the rat from the meat. This was extremely sanitary and cruel. According to the text, it states, ""There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms, and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it."" Workers were also capable of changing the meat into; however, they wanted them, such as turning the meat brown or making the meat ""spoil."" They would use chemistry and machines to change spoiled meat. If it were so difficult to get these meats to change, they would sell it as a number three grade meat. According to the text, it states, ""Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad. Formerly these had been sold as ""Number Three Grade,"" but later on, some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron."" The workers also rubbed meat in soda to get meat to go from sour to sweet and change the bad odor. After doing this, they would provide it to people over the free lunch counter. These conditions were very harsh, but workers did not care about receiving the public; they only wanted money. ",464,2

He also adds that no one pays attention to what goes in the sausage as long as its made.

This explains how they would put spoiled meat with fresh meat, instead of throwing the spoiled meat out. If the factory didn't put the spoiled meat in sausage, they would rub it with soda to take away the small, or they would use chemicals to enhance aspects of the meat.

Finally, once the factory discovered how to take the bone out of a ham, they would insert a white-hot iron, and they would go on to sell ""boneless hams"" or ""California hams"" and fancy ""skinned hams"" which all were filled with spoiled meat. However no one would buy skinned hams, until they were cooked, and chopped up fine, which they then called ""head cheese"".

The students were so blind that they didn't even realise they were performing something close to the Nazi soldier symbol. The kids were also not just doing it blindly.

Just like the Nazis, if they didnt do what Hitler wanted them to do, well they could just die or go to jail. So that shows that some might have been forced into it.

The main reason that the experiment was able to grow as fast as it did in the short amount of time that it was active was because of the way that the experiment looked to those outside of it. The author says ""All of the students were issued a member card and each of them received a special assignment, like designing a Third Wave Banner, stopping non-members from entering the class, or other tasks to bring honor to the movement,"" (CommonLit 3). It is common knowledge that envy and jealousy are present in every human being, and this must be the reason that so many outside students joined. As described in the quote, there were many things within the experiment that were exclusive of outside students. The students out of the experiment must have felt a desire to join in with the other students, an indirect form of peer pressure, if you will. The experiment was ended early due to its rapidly increasing intensity, and the operator of the experiment feared what would become of it were it to continue, thus he ended it. Jones' fear is expressed in the quote, ""By the fourth day of the experiment, the students became increasingly involved in the project and their discipline and loyalty to the project was so outstanding that Jones felt it was slipping out of control,"" (CommonLit 5). It is clearly expressed that Jones was fearful of the students' increasing intensity and thus decided to end it, especially through the description ""that Jones felt it was slipping out of control.",333,3
1.0249459,0.32089368,11c3509b7b43,814d6b,"The Third Wave developed over such a short period of time because of how seriously the students reacted to the regime of the Third Wave. After the reading explains what rules were outlined to students, the text states, ""As the week went on, Jones’ class transformed into a group with a supreme sense of discipline and community.  [...] This resulted in dramatic improvements to the efficiency, or orderliness, of the class. [...] After only three days, the experiment took on a life of its own, with students from all over the school joining in. The class expanded from initial 30 students to 43 attendees"" (CommonLit). This cluster of text routes shows how legitimately the student took directions because the students did not even hesitate to follow orders nor did they question the ethics of some of the rules. For example, not a single student questioned the morals of the salute when it was purposefully intended to resemble that of the Nazi regime's salute. This not only proves how naive minor's can be to their superiors but also demonstrates how quickly society can follow one another when the majority is committing said action. This is the classic case that everyone and their neighbor's mom told you as a kid: ""If your friend jumped off a bridge would you jump too?""- in this case and many, yes, you would be more likely to commit an action, even if it may be questionable, if your peers are also participating in the action. This fact connects back not only many examples throughout human history but in varying life forms across the globe. Birds for example learn to fly, walk, eat, etc. by watching their siblings and following the mother. It is human nature to follow the pack and unfortunately it is not always a benefit to society.
